<p><em>(For Marius Kociejowski) </em><br><br><br><br>

<strong>1</strong><br><br><br><br>

Poseidon’s bull springs from the waves. <br><br><br><br>

White, deliriously beautiful<br><br>
slated as sacrifice to the god of the sea.<br><br>
A deal is a deal, after all. <br><br><br><br>

Old King Minos is smitten<br><bR>
his wife feels Aphrodite’s curse <br><br>
tickling her thighs, chewing the womb of her dreams.<br><br>
Next stop after Smitten? <br><br><br><br>

Bull unslaughtered. <br><br>
A double stands in, <br><br>
one tauros looks much like another<br><br>
(<em>videlicet </em>any Iberian corrida). <br><br>
Daedalus, supreme mechanic, asked to contrive<br><br>
a wooden heifer into which Pasiphae<br><br>
inserts her queenly body after dark<br><br>
so a bull’s mighty pizzle<br><br>
might navigate a trunk road <br><br>
through the interior of her dark continent. <br><br>
Cue moonshine. White disc of a bull-face waltzing. <br><br>
And Aphrodite’s floating clouds of laughter<br><br>
feathering a full moon. <br><br><br><br>

Outcome on the far side of the equals sign: <br><br>
Minotaur. <br><br>
First bellow announces<br><br>
flawed genealogies<br><br>
miscegenation of species<br><br>
omission from next year’s royal Sandringham photographs. <br><br><br><br>

Daedalus must now construct a labyrinth <br><br>
in which our therianthrope<br><br>
becomes a solitary lifer. <br><br>
Condemned at birth <br><br>
like Oedipus <br><br>
before he even knows what’s hit him. <br><br>
Half-man half-bull<br><br>
keeping all his ontologies open. <br><br>
Daedalus & Son obliged to join his party: <br><br>
a fellow imprisoned on the isle of ingenuity<br><br>
in a Royal Society of one. <br><br><br><br>

Dark in there, and damp, <br><br>
a cellar in Beirut, say, or a room in the Lubyanka, <br><br>
Polish cattle trucks circa 1943. <br><br>
Took away his liberty, not his know-how. <br><br>
Wings fashioned for both father and son. <br><br>
In the dark hear the clink of makeshift tools. <br><br>
POWs digging through the stalag, as Icarus stands look-out. <br><br>
Half-bird half-man<br><br>
they lift off by the light of the moon<br><br>
(to bullman bellows – why can’t I FLY?) <br><br>
evading Cretan ground-to-air artillery, the Minoan flak. <br><br>
Noon next day, swooping over wine-dark seas, <br><br>
Icarus ventures higher even than an eagle dares and<br><br>
SPLASH<br><br>
down he goes in the water<br><br>
highest of all high-divers. <br><br>
Final column of the young man’s life<br><br>
one line of zeroes, dioxide bubbles<br><br>
rising from the swervy blue<br><br>
where a distant waxwing plummets. <br><br>
Time stops. His father’s wings outstretch, hold still. <br><br>
A windhover in heaven. <br><br>
The future now a speeding car windscreen<br><br>
catching the onrush of a sudden storm<br><br>
before wipers flick<br><br>
to synchronise the blinding wet away. <br><br>
The font down there<br><br>
in that big blue baptistery<br><br>
(where Icarus is christened for the second time) <br><br>
big enough to swallow the whole world. <br><br>
Daedalus watches tomorrow drown. <br><br>
How exactly had he ever engineered today? <br><br><br><br>

Poseidon opens that same fluent hole<br><br>
from whence a white bull thrashed out, <br><br>
closes one eye, yawns, <br><br>
briefly contented with his meal. <br><br><br><br>



<strong>2</strong><br><br><br><br>

Minotaur has regular eating habits, <br><br>
according to the Gnomon’s mighty shadow: <br><br>
each nine years seven youths and seven virgins. <br><br>
Proteinaceous, though lacking in roughage. <br><br><br><br>

One by one they’re pointed through<br><br>
vast labyrinth doors carved by Ghiberti. <br><br>
Rite of passage for the catechumens<br><br>
behind bronze gates<br><br>
opening on hell and heaven. <br><br>
One by one taken apart and eaten<br><br>
at leisure, organs sorted<br><br>
according to size piquancy vitamin quotient<br><br>
acidity (lifers tending to the bilious). <br><br><br><br>

Time comes round again, <br><br>
the face of Aegeus in Athens is sad. <br><br>
I’ll go, says his son Theseus -<br><br>
old man so heavy with the tribute demanded<br><br>
it makes a young one grieve –<br><br>
why ever agree to such danegeld? <br><br>

No, no, no. <br><br><br><br>

Dad, I said I’d go. <br><br>
I’ll handle it. <br><br>
So go he goes and handles it<br><br>
the way Michael did for his old man Vito Corleone. <br><br>
Only a question of killing, after all. <br><br><br><br>

<strong>3</strong><br><br><br><br>

Now another curse from Aphrodite<br><br>
(never any shortage there). <br><br>
Over in Crete Ariadne takes one swift look<br><br>
at this Athenian prince, falls<br><br>
entirely as though she were playing her mother, he the big white bull<br><br>
thrashing already inside her. <br><br>
Theseus, her flesh thinks not her mind, <br><br>
designed by Zeus to fit so snug between my thighs. <br><br>
Anything, then, Prinnie. Name your price. <br><br><br><br>

Entry and exit, he replies. <br><br>
Must get in there<br><br>
kill<br><br>
then out again, scrub down, and home. <br><br><br><br>

Here my love’s a little glamour and a clew. <br><br>
With one you kill him, my half-brother, <br><br>
with the other <br><br>
find your way back here to me. <br><br>
The thread’s umbilical. <br><br><br><br>

One condition only, given so great love<br><br>
to betray my flesh and blood<br><br>
for a crew of alien carpetbaggers hunting gold<br><br>
this quisling passion they’ll call it. <br><br>
Little tart, no better than she should be. <br><br><br><br>

Take me with you darling when you go.     <br><br><br><br>

<strong>4</strong><br><br><br><br>

Done. Ariadne sails along with him. <br><br>
On Naxos two days later dumps her. <br><br>
One ancient parish record says she hangs herself<br><br>
using the magical thread of that same clew<br><br>
brought our boy safely through the labyrinth<br><br>
once he’d slaughtered her half-brother. <br><br>
Anything to quell the wandering womb<br><br>
Greeks reckoned made for a woman’s throat <br><br>
without man’s gravity to hold it down. <br><br>
Or bull’s. <br><br>
Back in Greek waters<br><br>
our lads still carousing on deck<br><br>
Signor Hero forgets to change black sail to white<br><br>
as agreed with the old man a lifetime (plus one day) ago<br><br>
in Athens. <br><br><br><br>

Aegeus has stared out from cliff-tops<br><br>
day after day after day<br><br>
sees those black sails at last and knows<br><br>
Minotaur has had a rich and royal meal<br><br>
(his one and only) <br><br>
he throws himself, dim-eyed and doting, into the sea<br><br>
which promptly absorbs his flesh<br><br>
bones blood name<br><br>
henceforth the Aegean<br><br>
introducing him later that day<br><br>
to the artificer’s son. <br><br>
Divers from diverse generations. <br><br>
No shoes required. No crowns. <br><br>
Subaquean protocol alone obtains down here. <br><br><br><br>

Poseidon licks his lips with satisfaction. <br><br>
Snoozes wetly as amniotic tides<br><br>
salute the moon. How fluently the hours<br><br>
proceed. <br><br><br><br>

<strong>5</strong><br><br><br><br>

Years later…decades – the calendar’s occluded here –<br><br>
Theseus in need of a wife<br><br>
(who lost the Amazonian mother of his son<br><br>
Hippolytus) <br><br>
picks up Phaedra, Ariadne’s sister (well, why not?). <br><br>
Gospels tell us <br><br>
best not to let the right hand know<br><br>
what the left is doing. <br><br><br><br>




<strong>6</strong><br><br><br><br>

Dear Phaedra, <br><br>
I hope you are happy with him now. <br><br>
I remember that first night on the boat, how happy I was. Ravished and ravishing. The tide beneath us swelling almost as much as he did. <br><br>
Felt like our dear mother must have done with old Tauros Blanco in his high field, white as the hair on Poseidon’s waves, squeezing and thrashing through her harbour walls. <br><br>
On Naxos that night he led me to the tanglewood<br><br>
only noticing after our third embrace<br><br>
a shrew, its minute neck broken<br><br>
staring so emptily<br><br>
up into the moon’s white face. <br><br>
We stepped apart then<br><br>
as though an invisible cortège<br><br>
must be given passage between us. <br><br>
(Memory like an elephant, haven’t I?) <br><br>
Live here in heaven now with Dionysus my redeemer, as you might have read in the periodicals. A god’s wife. Dinners are grand, believe me. They come from such enormous distances to get here. Some haven’t eaten for a year. And some have suns for eyes. Certain evenings I have to wear shades even to sit at the mahogany table and keep smiling. All in the fast lane, chauffeured along at the speed of light. <br><br>
Some nights when he goes off<br><br>
to the great consult<br><br>
I stare at distant fires<br><br>
a million miles away<br><br>
a million years<br><br>
see mighty shadows<br><br>
(part of this family once) <br><br>
raising their mighty shadow hands to the flames<br><br>
as if to keep warm inside time’s ruins. <br><br>
Tell him that I resent nothing. Except maybe our half-brother. Euthanasia really wasn’t the answer, I’ve come to believe. A vegetarian diet might well have calmed him. Or maybe a beautiful white heifer, sprinkled with the merest hint of Poseidon’s magic salt. A little salted bull’s wife settling beneath him. She could have shouted at midnight almost as loud as he did. Or I did once. <br><br>
Your loving sister, <br><br>
Ariadne<br><br><br><br>

<strong>7</strong><br><br><br><br>

Aphrodite still looking to get even. <br><br>
Gods never call it quits<br><br>
and goddesses are worse. <br><br>
There in the palace Phaedra<br><br>
between the gilt frames and the polished tables<br><br>
falls in love with her stepson Hippolytus<br><br>
while Theseus is off abroad somewhere, cutting deals<br><br>
in platinum promises and futures<br><br>
(New York, Tokyo. Fill in the gaps for yourself.) <br><br>
Our boy’s devoted to Artemis<br><br>
rejects with priestly disdain her rival’s unseemly advances<br><br>
to Aphrodite’s fury. <br><br>
<em>Ressentiment</em>: Nietzsche’s motor of history. <br><br>
Now vengeance wakes to its duties: <br><br>
it is time once more. <br><br><br><br>

Phaedra hangs herself from rafters<br><br>
leaving a letter blaming the boy<br><br>
for seducing her. Theseus returning<br><br>
believes the posthumous libel<br><br>
banishes his son, calling down one of three curses<br><br>
still owed him by Poseidon<br><br>
that master of the salt mines of the heart. <br><br>
Cue bell sound; end-of-round tally. <br><br>
Two sisters gone from his bed into the same tight noose. <br><br>
How vagrant wombs migrate into the throat’s constriction. <br><br><br><br>

Now wait now see<br><br>
what delights arrive once more<br><br>
in this world of Newton’s Third Law: <br><br>
towards each action, an equal and opposite<br><br>
pendulum swings. What goes around<br><br>
comes around. <br><br><br><br>

As the carriage gets to shore<br><br>
where once he’d sucked in a winged son<br><br>
once spewed forth a white bull<br><br>
Poseidon emits another in answer to his distant promise<br><br>
(a deal is a deal, after all) <br><br>
not beautiful like the white one<br><br>
merely vast ferocious speedy. <br><br>
Minotaur horns. Minotaur rage. <br><br>
Horses panic, throw Hippolytus, <br><br>
drag him to an early death. <br><br><br><br>

Only then does Theseus learn<br><br>
how Phaedra in her fatal misery <br><br>
had lied, turning all Poseidon’s oceans<br><br>
into one large angry womb.     <br><br><br><br>






<strong>8</strong><br><br><br><br>

<em>Poseidon’s Diary</em><br><br><br><br>

My epidermis, remember. <br><br>
The itching, heaving<br><br>
terrible flesh of the sea. <br><br><br><br>

Who sail in boats<br><br>
flirt with winds<br><br>
(sozzled, dancing at midnight on deck) <br><br>
black sails I carry <br><br>
as a rhino carries a raven on his back. <br><br><br><br>

Black sails<br><br>
a nocturnal butterfly, no more, <br><br>
anthracite moth to navigate the white thigh of my breakers. <br><br>
Tiniest irritation <br><br>
mischief and death can fling<br><br>
upon my tides.  <br><br><br><br>

Our hero’s father, hurling himself into waves below, <br><br>
a caterpillar flung into my leaky beard. <br><br>
The child is father to the man.    <br><br>
And this one’s gift? To procreate death. <br><br>
A womb black and leathery as midnight bats. <br><br><br><br>

<strong>9</strong><br><br><br><br>

Note how Ariadne and her sister Phaedra<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   both take Theseus<br><br>
or vice versa. <br><br><br><br>

Some say Ariadne hanged herself on Naxos<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   all agree<br><br>
Phaedra did one day in Greece. <br><br><br><br>

White bull’s intolerable beauty<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   ejaculated from Poseidon’s waves<br><br>
till Hyppolytus re-fills his silk salt gap. <br><br><br><br>

See how He likes to keep things balanced<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   sea against sky<br><br>
fate up above mirrored by judgment below. <br><br><br><br>


<strong>10</strong><br><br><br><br>

This day Poseidon<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   sees his son blinded<br><br>
weeps in the salt of sea and rain<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   no one seeing that face<br><br>
daubed on a seaside postcard <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   would notice, gazing on the ancient’s<br><br>
liquid features, graysoaked<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   waterfalls of grief through the bluff of his beard<br><br>
a liquid funeral mourning. Just sea, <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   salt’s symmetry. Not one eye, you notice, <br><br>
nor the other – both at once. <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   No monocle, no asymmetric tear<br><br>
always two moons gleaming in a lachrymatory<br><br>.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Meanwhile Aphrodite coughs three<br><br>
dry white clouds into the blue and chuckles. <br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing her, remembering the terms of engagement<br><br>
between them, Poseidon spat out white waves too<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   eyes brimming at last with salt<br><br>
and laughter. Some mariners made landfall<br><br>
   that day. Others drowned.   <br><br><br><br>
