            <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Dame Vera Lynn, life&rsquo;s normal temporal sequence has  gone awry.  Simultaneously dragged  relentlessly back to the past and under equally relentless demand to sing a  song about the future, Britain&rsquo;s most famous Second World War singer continues  to be effectively denied a present.  Like  Dame Vera herself,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> the song<u>,</u> &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;, has become nationally iconic: the metonym of World War II;  ritually sung at anniversary commemorations of the war and at reunions; like  the fourth stanza of Binyon&rsquo;s &lsquo;For The Fallen&rsquo; (&lsquo;they shall not grow old&hellip;&rsquo;)  hymn-like, invested with a quasi-religious, patriotic quality.  At the same time, its resonances have been  invoked in popular culture, its strains the ironic accompaniment to the  explosion of atom bombs in Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s <u>Dr. Strangelove, or How I  Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</u> (1964); deployed with alienating  effect in the Pink Floyd song &lsquo;Vera&rsquo; (<u>The Wall</u>, 1982); the eerie aural  backdrop to the Tower of Terror ride in Walt Disney World, California.  This essay examines a song often sung but  less often reflected upon, and, through it, investigates the phenomenon that is  &lsquo;Dame Vera Lynn&rsquo;.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1930s, rather than write or commission their own  songs, singers visited music publishers to browse through new compositions:  each performance then brought in royalties to publisher and composer.  Vera Lynn came across &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; in  the autumn of 1939 at Irwin Dash, a Tin Pan Alley publishers.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; Its composition (it is dated 1939)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a> therefore <em>preceded</em> the war.  The  song was the work of the well-established, London-based songwriters Ross Parker  and Hugh Charles, with Charles providing the lyrics for Parker's melody. Lynn first sang it (along with  &lsquo;You Can&rsquo;t Black Out The Moon&rsquo;) that autumn on tour with the Ambrose Orchestra,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> beginning a still-unbroken tripartite connection between it, herself and the  war.  At the time, Lynn was 22.  She had begun singing as a 7-year-old in the  clubs of east London, billed as a &lsquo;distinctive  child vocalist&rsquo;; at 11, she was a member of a juvenile troupe, &lsquo;Madame Harris&rsquo;s  Kracker Kabaret Kids&rsquo;.  She metamorphosed  into a professional &lsquo;crooner&rsquo;, featuring on dance band records with Joe Loss  and Charlie Kunz and making her first radio broadcast in 1935.  In 1937, she became a vocalist with Bert  Ambrose and his band and when, in the winter of that year, the Ambrose Octet  was formed in its stead, she joined full-time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp; The singer of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; in the  autumn of 1939 was therefore a well-known stage and radio performer on the  verge of a solo career but the &lsquo;established character&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> of &lsquo;Vera Lynn&rsquo;, as understood today, was not yet in existence. <br>
              Even so, &lsquo;Vera Lynn&rsquo; was  already something of a construction.  Lynn had been born Vera Welch.  To join the Kracker Kabaret Kids, she sought  a &lsquo;more comfortable name&rsquo;. Her main concern was to find something &lsquo;short,  easily remembered, and that would stand out on a bill &ndash; something that would  allow for plenty of space around each letter&rsquo;. A family conference decided on  her grandmother&rsquo;s maiden name.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; The connotations of &lsquo;Welch&rsquo; (un-English, to  &lsquo;welsh&rsquo; on a debt) were therefore exchanged for those of the more mellifluous &lsquo;Lynn&rsquo;, a variation on &lsquo;Linn&rsquo;,  which means lime or linden tree and also pool or cascade.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp; With the prefix &lsquo;Vera&rsquo; (&lsquo;truth&rsquo;), the name  encapsulated a reliable (&lsquo;vera lynn&rsquo; said quickly sounds like &lsquo;verily&rsquo;),  pastoral, Falstaffian England,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> very much in tune with the propagandist myth of the nation promoted, not least  by Churchill, during the Second World War.   In this sense, &lsquo;Vera Lynn&rsquo; was what the British and their allies were  fighting for.  But the ongoing  construction of &lsquo;Vera Lynn&rsquo; depended &ndash; and continues to depend &ndash; on &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet  Again&rsquo;.  What, then, was the significance  of a piece which the performer herself described simply as &lsquo;a perfect example  of what you might call the greetings card song&rsquo; with &lsquo;unpretentious off-the-peg  sentiments&rsquo;?<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lyrics to &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; are, as Vera Lynn points  out, easily learned<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> and nationally known: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll  meet again don&rsquo;t know where,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t  know when,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I  know we&rsquo;ll meet again some sunny day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep  smilin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; just like you always do<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till  the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away,</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So  will you please say hello to the folks that I know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell  them I won&rsquo;t be long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll  be happy to know that as you saw me go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was  singing this song.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll  meet again etc.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a></p>
            <p>It is less well known that  the song has two verses.  Today these  tend to be omitted: Lynn herself only ever sang the first one (largely because  recordings could not exceed three minutes).<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp; The text is as follows:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s  say goodbye with a smile dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just  for a while dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  must part,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t  let the parting upset you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll  not forget you sweetheart.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After  the rain comes the rainbow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll  see the rain go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never  fear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  two can wait for tomorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodbye  to sorrow my dear.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>14</sup></a></p>
            <p>Lynn sums up the message of  the song as &lsquo;people hoping in spite of everything to meet again&rsquo;, the  sentiments of &lsquo;everybody who&rsquo;s saying goodbye to somebody&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp; But, though the setting is, as she says,  personal and intimate &ndash; &lsquo;from me to you&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a> &ndash; it is also a highly public song, broadcast throughout the world during the  war and in latter years sung <em>en masse</em> at national commemorations.  Like a Donnean valediction, therefore, it has  a bifocal quality: private reassurance as mass spectacle.  This was replicated in Lynn&rsquo;s role as &lsquo;the Forces&rsquo;  Sweetheart&rsquo; (discussed further below), which combined the personal and the  representative.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The song&rsquo;s dramatic situation is of two people  parting.  The speaker is going to go  somewhere else (&lsquo;as you saw me go&rsquo;).  It  is likely that the addressee is either returning, or staying at, home: &lsquo;will  you please say hello to the folks that I know&rsquo; suggests that this person will  remain with familiar friends and family while the other is with strangers.  There is no explicit reference to war (except  for the hint in &lsquo;dark clouds&rsquo;, a use of the pathetic fallacy which might also  suggest the residue of explosions), but the song&rsquo;s ineradicable association  with the Second World War fixes the scenario as that in which the departing  speaker is a member of the military off on active service.  As the combat forces were exclusively male,  this designates the person being left as the speaker&rsquo;s wife or girlfriend  (&lsquo;dear&rsquo;, &lsquo;sweetheart&rsquo;).  The seductive  quality of the music &ndash; in particular the sultry chromatics of the opening  before the soar up to &lsquo;when&rsquo; (a tricky interval of a minor sixth) &ndash; reinforces  this impression of intimacy.  The lyric  is accordingly consistent with a female-populated home front.  Given that the setting suggests a male  speaker, it is therefore odd that the song (like &lsquo;Sally&rsquo; for Gracie Fields)  became a hit for a <em>woman</em> singer.   In interview, Vera Lynn argued that it was not written specifically for  either sex.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, a recording of it by  her exists in which some significant changes have been made:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So  I&rsquo;ll just say hello to the folks that you know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell  them you won&rsquo;t be long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll  be happy to know that as I saw you go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You  were singing this song.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              Though the pronouns are  reversed here to accommodate a female singer, the version still maintains the  speaker of the &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll meet again&rsquo; section as a man (&lsquo;<em>you</em> were singing  this song&rsquo;) even though his words are sung in a woman&rsquo;s voice.  The result is that the character who tells  the other to &lsquo;keep smilin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the person automatically invested  with superior courage and fortitude &ndash; remains a male part.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The song urges cheerful endurance of the discomforts and  dangers of staying at home: &lsquo;I am going away but you must be brave.&rsquo;&nbsp; The message replicates that of another lyric  composed on its speaker&rsquo;s leaving for the wars: John Donne&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Valediction: of  Weeping&rsquo;.  As the voice of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet  Again&rsquo; exhorts his wife or girlfriend to &lsquo;keep smilin&rsquo; thro&rsquo;, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let the  parting upset you&rsquo;, so the speaker of Donne&rsquo;s poem bids his mistress (another voiceless  addressee) with some petulance to &lsquo;weep me not dead in thine arms&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp; Effectively, in both lyrics, &lsquo;blame&rsquo; for the  trauma of separation is reassigned from the politicians and military leaders  who have initiated and wage the war to the emotional response of the woman  obliged to remain behind.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a war poem, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; is, like its most famous  singer, imprinted with the disorderly narratology of conflict.  The earliest audiences of <u>The Iliad</u> all knew its plot in detail; readers of recent First World War novels such as  Pat Barker&rsquo;s <u>Regeneration</u> trilogy also know which side wins in the  end.  Such works can deploy narrative  devices such as suspense (the reader knows what&rsquo;s going to happen but doesn&rsquo;t  know when), foreshadowing and back shadowing.   Literature written <em>during</em> a war, when it is not known when or how  that war is going to conclude, has a different narratology: open-ended,  subjunctive, uncertain.  This is the  tenor of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;.  The  hypothesis is that we <em>will</em> meet again but the conditions that must be  satisfied to fulfil it are vague.  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t  know where / Don&rsquo;t know when&rsquo; runs the lyric, only specifying that the  prospective reunion will be &lsquo;when the bright skies drive the dark clouds far  away&rsquo; (although this is countered by the relative confidence of &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be  long&rsquo; and &lsquo;I <em>know</em> we&rsquo;ll meet again&rsquo;).   Indeed, the second verse points to an endlessly deferred conclusion: &lsquo;we  two can wait for tomorrow&rsquo;.  The song  itself is potentially eternal: the meta-textual structure &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll be happy to  know that as you saw me go, / I was singing this song. / We&rsquo;ll meet again etc&rsquo;  leads perpetually back to the beginning.   Like the war, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; could go on forever.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sense of an uncertain outcome reinforces the  eschatological nature of the song.  &lsquo;I  know we&rsquo;ll meet again some sunny day&rsquo; might refer to a summer reunion, but it  could with equal ease connote a bright afterlife.  In the context of World War II, the speaker  was not just going away, but going away to war and possible death.  Vera Lynn recalls singing the song in Burma to her smallest ever  audience: two men who were too wounded to be moved.  &lsquo;I could see what they were thinking,&rsquo; Lynn wrote.  &lsquo;In the end, only one got home.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; In such a scenario, the song undergoes a  metamorphosis, now becoming an exchange between two comrades who will not both  survive the conflict.  In recent years, Lynn has been informed by  servicemen&rsquo;s widows that &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; has been the last song played at  their husbands&rsquo; funerals; she herself sang it at the funeral of Billy Butlin.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp; In a charity concert after the war, she was  asked to perform it after a comic version of <u>Macbeth</u>.  Advancing onto the darkened stage, she began  to sing, only to notice that lying on the floor were all the &lsquo;bodies&rsquo; from the  play&rsquo;s final bloody scene.  The only  thing to do was to render a humorous version, so she gestured to each &lsquo;corpse&rsquo;  in turn, while assuring it, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll meet again&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp; (And in addition to a comic, the lyric can  bear a sinister interpretation, as evidenced by Disney&rsquo;s Tower of Terror ride: &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll meet again&rsquo;  can be construed as threatening.)&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhorting courage, recalling home, providing an  optimistic view of life after death, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; was part of the war  effort.  &lsquo;Musicians,&rsquo; Lynn wrote in her  autobiography, &lsquo;are not cowards, although the press had a good time suggesting  they were.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp; When she herself went to volunteer, she was  told that she would be most &lsquo;valuable&rsquo; &ndash; indeed, &lsquo;vital&rsquo; &ndash; as an entertainer:  people &lsquo;were going to need entertainment more than they&rsquo;d ever done in their  lives&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp; Primarily, her remit, as she saw it, was to  boost morale:<br>
              In wartime music fills an important niche  in national life.  In the Second World  War it was not used as a wardrum, to beat up martial spirit, but to provide  good cheer for the forces, to stimulate workers in the war factories and to  hearten people in their homes.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a></p>
            <p>But carrying on the  business of entertainment provided an example as well as a distraction.  Insisting that the show must go on while the London theatres were being  bombed was &lsquo;a small act of defiance&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp; This, of course, is what &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;  calls for: &lsquo;keep smilin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; as a military tactic.  When, in 1941, Lynn&rsquo;s BBC radio programme, <u>Sincerely  Yours</u>, began to go out, she felt that it did have &lsquo;slight warlike  intentions&rsquo;, going head-to-head with the Germans&rsquo; favourite, &lsquo;Lili  Marlene&rsquo;.  <u>Sincerely Yours</u> was  heard throughout occupied Europe as people met again and again around  their clandestine wirelesses, creating the potential for future reunions &ndash; many  with the singer herself.  For Lynn, it was the opportunity  to &lsquo;reach out&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Like me,&rsquo; she wrote  later, &lsquo;many [women] found new possibilities and a new confidence in their war  role.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp; <u>Sincerely Yours</u> &ndash; and &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet  Again&rsquo; &ndash; was therefore empowerment of a kind.   Perhaps in reaction to this, some M.P.s and retired officers &ndash; &lsquo;none of  whom were actually doing any of the fighting&rsquo; &ndash; said publicly that sentimental  songs produced sentimental soldiers &lsquo;who would desert at the first catch in a  crooner&rsquo;s voice&rsquo;.  Questions were asked  in the House of Commons and the BBC set up an Anti-Slush  Committee.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp; The criticism, according to Lynn, was &lsquo;soon squashed&rsquo;: &lsquo;as  I saw it, I was reminding the boys of what they were really fighting for, the  precious personal things rather than the ideologies and theories.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp; They were fighting, in other words, for &lsquo;Vera  Lynn&rsquo;.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This emphasis on the &lsquo;precious personal things&rsquo; was central  to Lynn&rsquo;s role during the war.  In 1939, she topped a list of favourite  female vocalists chosen by men of the Tank Corps and also won the British  Expeditionary Force&rsquo;s singing popularity poll.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp; As a result, she acquired the title &lsquo;the  Forces&rsquo; Sweetheart&rsquo;, cast, in her own words, as &lsquo;a believable girl-next-door,  big-sister, universal-fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>31</sup></a>&nbsp; This was also the persona projected on <u>Sincerely  Yours</u>, announced in the <u>Radio Times</u> as &lsquo;To the men of the Forces: a  letter in words and music from Vera Lynn&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp; Soon the &lsquo;letter&rsquo; was receiving one to two  thousand a week in return from the troops.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp; Lynn tried to keep in contact  with them, sending out photographs.   Later, she began to deliver personal messages to individuals over the  airwaves, visiting hospitals and nursing homes before the show &lsquo;so that I could  tell Gunner Jones or Bombardier Brown that his wife had just had a baby, that I  had talked to her and that mother and child were just fine.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>34</sup></a> The result was to make her &lsquo;a message carrier  between separated people&rsquo;,<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>35</sup></a> a private spokesperson, even advocate, recapitulating on a larger scale the  effect of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;.  As she  wrote later, the song was &lsquo;a very basic human message of the sort that people  want to say to each other but find embarrassing actually to put into  words.  Ordinary English people don&rsquo;t, on  the whole, find it easy to expose their feelings even to those closest to them.  [&hellip;]&nbsp;  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; [&hellip;] would go at least a little way towards doing it  for them.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>36</sup></a>&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn reprised this intimate  yet representative role in her tour to Burma in 1944 under the  auspices of ENSA (the Entertainments National Service Association).  Touring the hospitals, she sensed that  &lsquo;direct, individual contact&rsquo; was more important to the men than singing and  music.  &lsquo;How are things at home?&rsquo; was a  constant refrain.  The reply &lsquo;business as  usual&rsquo; was given &lsquo;as a matter of pride&rsquo;:<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>37</sup></a> &lsquo;keep smilin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; given new urgency and meaning.  The primary effect of Lynn&rsquo;s tour was to reduce the  distance felt by the troops.  &lsquo;Home can&rsquo;t  be too far away can it [sic],&rsquo; one soldier remarked, &lsquo;if you can just appear  among us.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>38</sup></a> But another effect was to introduce a  glamorous woman into the male space of war.   Though the ENSA uniform was sombre &ndash; &lsquo;a severely military-looking  outfit&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>39</sup></a> &ndash; Lynn also spent amassed clothes coupons on a tight-fitting, pale pink chiffon  dress and, despite the heat, wore lipstick.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>40</sup></a>&nbsp; A picture emerges of a strong, healthy,  sexually attractive woman reassuring and comforting men who are wounded and  immobilised: a complete reversal of the gender dynamics of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent televised commemoration of the 60th  anniversary of VE Day, the song was sung, not by Vera Lynn, whose final public  performance was on the 50th anniversary, but by a young Welsh  soprano, Katherine Jenkins.  Jenkins was,  the comp&egrave;re announced, the &lsquo;new Forces&rsquo; Sweetheart&rsquo;, and, as she and Dame Vera  embraced, it seemed that a torch was being passed on.  But several factors suggest that the role has  fallen into desuetude.  With mass  communication, there is no need for the kind of personal contact which Lynn provided.  Troops can phone and email their families  themselves.  Moreover, the role seems to  depend upon the nature of the conflict.   British troops currently in Iraq are not fighting for a near-universally  supported cause as was the case in World War II: a celebrity, indeed, would be  more likely to be found voicing opposition to the war, rather than acting as  the troops&rsquo; darling.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>41</sup></a> For Lynn, being the Forces&rsquo;  Sweetheart involved rather more than singing: she did, and does, work for  them.  And public opinion, at least as  far as Iraq is concerned, would not  be satisfied with the all-too-vague promises of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Vera Lynn got back from Burma, she wondered whether  &lsquo;all would be anticlimax from now on for me&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>42</sup></a>&nbsp; Conscious that her connection with the war  was now indelible, she anticipated its end by moving to the Sussex countryside in November  1944: &lsquo;there was a feeling that an era was passing which I had been very much a  part of&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>43</sup></a>&nbsp; At the end of the 1940s, she went to the United States and, with &lsquo;Auf  Wiederseh&rsquo;n Sweetheart&rsquo; (notably these words are the German equivalent of  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo;), became the first British artist to top the US charts.  She appeared regularly on Tallulah Bankhead&rsquo;s <u>Big Show</u>.  and also had top ten  hits in Britain and her own BBC series in the &rsquo;50s and  &rsquo;70s.  But these achievements are not the  ones that are remembered.  It is hard to  determine when &lsquo;Nostalgia&rsquo; as a phenomenon kicked in and &lsquo;Vera Lynn&rsquo; was  reconstructed.  According to Lynn  herself, it was simply that, as the years went by, people began to get more and  more nostalgic.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>44</sup></a>&nbsp; Made a Dame in 1975, when Harold Wilson was  Prime Minister, she became increasingly in demand to sing at Second World War  anniversaries and commemorations: at the 60th anniversary events  this year, her presence &ndash; even though she no longer sings publicly &ndash; was  indispensable.  At such commemorations  and reunions, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet Again&rsquo; has undergone another metamorphosis.  Now those who join in are in their eighties  and nineties.  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again&rsquo; might  signify &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll meet at next year&rsquo;s reunion&rsquo; but it must also now refer again to  that eschatological &lsquo;sunny day&rsquo; when late and present comrades come  together.  If this is true, then the  endlessly forward-looking lyric has turned to look backwards &ndash; become, in  effect, a memorial.  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reunion &ndash; meeting again &ndash; seems to have become newly  fashionable in recent years: the success of the Friends Reunited website is  just one example.  School or work  reunions tend to be (often highly emotionally-charged) occasions for catching  up, marking change and moving on.  But  such things are not possible in the endlessly deferred reunion of &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll Meet  Again&rsquo;.  Caught in a time loop, the song  resists &lsquo;closure&rsquo;.  In a similar way,  Vera Lynn is suspended too, at least until the blue skies drive the dark clouds  far away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
