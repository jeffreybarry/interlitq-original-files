            <p align="left">Our  Danny never had much of nose for danger. And that nearly got him killed.&nbsp; After years living on the breadline he went  to Gamblers Anonymous.&nbsp; Within a month  he&rsquo;d saved up four hundred and bought a wee Proton.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later he got a full set of  freshwater gear out the yellow paper.&nbsp;  That was him set. &nbsp;Ten years ago,  before his gambling took off big style, Danny was regular in the tranquil  places of Scotland.&nbsp; The lochs and salmon rivers.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t a bit of waterway in the country  he didn&rsquo;t have a fisherman&rsquo;s opinion on.</p>
            <p align="left">All  week at work he went on about how this was a new start.&nbsp; How there&nbsp;  was nothing like turning off the engine into that hissing silence.&nbsp; Getting the rods on the water, building the  fire and settling down to watch them floats.&nbsp;  The picture he painted made a big impression on Timmy.&nbsp; He asked Danny if he could come.&nbsp; He was fed up with weekend neds making life a  pure fuckin misery.&nbsp; Danny wanted to be  up in them high lands alone.&nbsp; He wanted  the first breaths of serenity in ten years to be his own.&nbsp; But he felt sorry for Timmy.&nbsp; Timmy was only thirty but being a natural  worrier he looked fifty.&nbsp; And neds always  pick on the weak so they&rsquo;d panned his windows so many times Timmy put council  shutters up.&nbsp; Steel. All weekend they&rsquo;d slam  bottles and rocks off them.&nbsp; It was  probably shell shock he suffered from.&nbsp;  If he phoned the cops the neds would stand there with their palms  out.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Us?&nbsp;  Rocks?&nbsp; Does somebody live in  there?&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon as the cops left it would  be like the battle of the Somme.&nbsp; All Timmy wanted was a weekend without  fear.&nbsp; Danny put a big smile on and told  him no bother. Of course.&nbsp; The company  would be good.&nbsp; Somebody to talk to. </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Yes!  said Timmy and punched the air.</p>
            <p align="left">So  as they put the last touches to next week&rsquo;s work schedule, Danny caught a glance  over and for the first time in years saw a flicker of delight cross Timmy&rsquo; s  face.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d scribble away worrying about  the schedule then his head would tilt up.&nbsp;  A smile appeared. His eyes wrinkled. And Danny could see the very  mountains Timmy was dreaming about.</p>
            <p align="left">They  left at half-four.&nbsp; Timmy brought the  bright orange waterproofs you get on building sites and a wee fishing rod he&rsquo;d  got for his tenth birthday.&nbsp; Danny had a  good hour laughing at that rod.&nbsp; How  these big fuckin salmon would snap it in two first bite and eventually got  Timmy to fling it out the window at Killiekrankie.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I&rsquo;ll  give ye one of my rods to keep ya wanker, said Danny. And off they went up the  A9.</p>
            <p align="left">Timmy  sat slack jawed at the scenery.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s  when Danny asked him if he&rsquo;s ever been up the Highlands  before.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Is  Saltcoats in the highlands?</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  gave Timmy a wee slap on the back of the head.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Saltcoats?&nbsp; Saltcoats? Ye mad?</p>
            <p align="left">Turns  out Timmy&rsquo;d never been anywhere without houses roads and shops. &nbsp;So as they turned off into the mountains he  marvelled.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;And  not a ned in sight, said Danny.</p>
            <p align="left">It  was all backpackers and cars with kayaks and canoes.&nbsp; People eating noodles by the side of the  road.&nbsp; Some waving.&nbsp; Some simply looking in the car. But without  menace.</p>
            <p align="left">They  parked under the dropping branches of a tree so it couldn&rsquo;t easily be seen.  When they got to the head of the loch Timmy stood staring down that water while  Danny set up the rods.&nbsp; Every now and  then he&rsquo;d hear Timmy saying wow! Or fuckin hell man! Two rods for Danny and one  for Timmy.&nbsp; Timmy loved his new rod and  kept asking if he really had to keep it.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;It&rsquo;s  yours, Danny said, scrape your name on it.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">He  showed Timmy how to tie the hook, set the float and cast.&nbsp; Then he got onto the floats.&nbsp; It never takes him long to get onto the  floats. Danny claims to have invented them.&nbsp;  Jif Lemons with a curtain hook screwed into the bottom.&nbsp; You put the line through the hook, slide the  float to the required depth(Danny was expert at that an all), &nbsp;wrap the line round the top and screw the lid  on. See them for miles.&nbsp; In white, grey  or rough water you can see them.&nbsp; Once  these three lemons were floating nicely out in the loch Danny lit the  fire.&nbsp; They had a conversation about the  smell of burning wood and cracked a bottle of Buckie each.</p>
            <p align="left">Life  didn&rsquo;t get any better.&nbsp; Relaxation took  ten years off Timmy. He leaned back on the grass and laughed.&nbsp; Looked up to the sky and shouted</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Sky.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">Letting  his voice raise up to the heavens.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Sky.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Sky.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Sky</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Your  float just bobbed, said Danny, watching as Timmy ran down to the water&rsquo;s edge  and grabbed his rod.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  will I do now?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Wait  till it bobs down again.</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  got beside him.&nbsp; Two men, four hands on  the rod.&nbsp; Ready.&nbsp; Waiting for that fish to swallow the bait.  They waited.&nbsp; But the float stayed where  it was.&nbsp; And the water was calm.&nbsp; Danny&rsquo;s grasp slackened.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Must&rsquo;ve  been a nibble just, said Danny,&nbsp; &#8212;Good  sign but.</p>
            <p align="left">He  left Timmy holding the rod by the side of the silver loch and the sun coming  down to the mountains in the west.</p>
            <p align="left">An  hour later as the water was turning red they heard a car.&nbsp; It parked behind theirs and Danny was  relieved to see it wasn&rsquo;t fishermen. It was just a guy and his bird.&nbsp; They got out laughing and came over.&nbsp; Nice night and all this.&nbsp; She had great sticky-out tits and a short  skirt more for clubbing than wilderness.&nbsp;  Timmy blew some check-that-out air though his pouted lips.&nbsp; Danny offered the guy a charge of the Buckie.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Cheers  mate</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Danny.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Cheers  Danny. I&rsquo;m Tam.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;That&rsquo;s  Timmy, said Danny.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;All  right Timmy my man.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;This  is Lydia,  bird.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Hi  yi, said Lydia,  and shook hands.</p>
            <p align="left">They  could smell her perfume.</p>
            <p align="left">Tam  produced a joint and they sat by the fire smoking. Danny was sure Tam caught  Timmy checking Lydia&rsquo;s  legs out.&nbsp; Caught him and smiled.&nbsp; Nudged her. &nbsp;Leaned in and, Danny said, told her to tug her  skirt up that bit more.&nbsp; It was red  knickers she had on.&nbsp; Right sexy red  knickers. &nbsp;Tam kept asking about fishing  and even though he didn&rsquo;t sound like a man interested in fishing Danny told  him.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;See  they floats?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Aye.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Know  what they are?</p>
            <p align="left">Tam  shrugged.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Jif  Lemons.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Jif  Lemons?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Fuck  aye! Said Danny proud of himself.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;They  things ye use in cooking? asked Lydia.</p>
            <p align="left">Now  he had them interested Danny described in detail how he invented them.&nbsp; How easy they are to see, no matter the  weather.&nbsp; How fishermen all over the  country use them now. &nbsp;The world even for  all he knows.&nbsp; But do they give him the  credit?&nbsp; No, do they fuck!&nbsp; All the time Tam&rsquo;s rubbing his hand slowly up  and down Lydia&rsquo;s  leg.&nbsp; Timmy and Danny catch each other&rsquo;s  glance about that whenever they can.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">Dark  is falling and Danny&rsquo;s on the difference between a Salmon and Trout&rsquo;s tail when  they hear another car.&nbsp; It parks behind  Tam&rsquo;s and two guys in their early twenties get out.&nbsp; Tam waves over.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;They&rsquo;re  here,&nbsp; says Tam to Lydia.</p>
            <p align="left">Over  they come.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Get  it? Says Tam.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;In  the car, says the one that looks like a gypsy.&nbsp;  The other one looks like a junkie.&nbsp;  He stands saying nothing.&nbsp; Staring  at Lydia&rsquo;s  legs.&nbsp; Not even looking away when she  catches him.&nbsp; Stares till she puts her  head down in fact.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got a carry  out and toss a can each to Danny and Timmy without asking who they are.&nbsp; They sit down, the junkie close to Lydia  so their legs are touching.&nbsp; Tam starts rubbing  her leg again and the other guy rolls a joint.&nbsp;  And all this is done in awkward silence.&nbsp;  Danny and Timmy fiddle with fishing tackle and throw some more wood on  the fire &ndash; the flames lighting them all up. Then Tam, in an artificially happy  voice, points to the floats.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Guess  what they are?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;They  yellow things.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  yellow things?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Out  there.</p>
            <p align="left">The  junkie looks. &#8212;Floats,  he says.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Aye  but what are they made out of?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Floaty  stuff, says Gypsy and burst out laughing, choking on smoke.&nbsp; Rolls over onto the grass and laughs far too  much. Tam boots him.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;No  &ndash; Jif fuckin Lemons.&nbsp; N&rsquo;at right Danny.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Aye,  says Danny. But nerves are setting in.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Tell  these two bams how you invented them, says Tam.</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  proceeds to tell.&nbsp; A burr of fear  unmistakeable in his voice.&nbsp; By this time  it&rsquo;s getting dark.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;That&rsquo;s  great, says Gypsy when he&rsquo;s finished, &#8212;I&rsquo;ll  have to remember to keep my Jif Lemons.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Talking  about lemons, says Tam, and gets up trailing Lydia  by the hand to the cars.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">He  takes a bag from Gypsy&rsquo;s car and goes to his own, opens the back door and says  something to Lydia.&nbsp; She crawls in backwards and lies on the  seat.&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s watching as Tam takes  one ankle and places it on the head rest.&nbsp;  Her other on the parcel shelf.&nbsp; Danny  and Timmy can&rsquo;t believe it. </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;D&rsquo;you  want fucked ya slut, he&rsquo;s saying as he drops his jeans. </p>
            <p align="left">She  says something.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  can&rsquo;t hear ye, d&rsquo;you want fucked?&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">There&rsquo;s  a whimper that sounds like a yes.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  can&rsquo;t fuckin hear ye,&nbsp; and he slaps her.  She yelps.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Yes!  she shouts.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Yes  what? he says holding a fist in the air.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  want fucked.</p>
            <p align="left">Bang!  He punches her.&nbsp; She starts crying.&nbsp; In he goes and closes the door.&nbsp; Danny and Timmy stare out at the floats.&nbsp; But the two other guys don&rsquo;t take their eyes  off the car.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a slap and a  yelp.&nbsp; Gypsy lights a joint and takes a  long suck as if he&rsquo;s trying to quench his lust.&nbsp;  The muffled cries of Tam shouting at Lydia  and the rocking of the car are hard to ignore. Especially when nobody&rsquo;s  mentioning it.&nbsp; When nobody&rsquo;s talking at  all. When nobody&rsquo;s saying nothing. </p>
            <p align="left">Tam  comes back doing up his jeans with a grin and hands Gypsy the red  knickers.&nbsp; He immediately stuffs them to  his face drawing in air.&nbsp; Danny and Timmy  are down at the waterside checking rods that don&rsquo;t need checked.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Does  this happen a lot? Timmy asked.</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  nodded a quick no and tried not to look at these guys.&nbsp; When he did Tam was tranquil as you like  smoking a jay; looking over the water.&nbsp;  He caught Danny&rsquo;s eye and winked.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Aye,  is all he said.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Fuck  sake Danny he&rsquo;s a psycho, whispered Timmy.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;They&rsquo;ll  probably go away soon.</p>
            <p align="left">The  other two were in the car now.&nbsp; Shouting  obscenities at Lydia.&nbsp; Taking turns fucking her.&nbsp; She started screaming.&nbsp; It first just like she did with Tam but soon  loud.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;No.  Please no! </p>
            <p align="left">Timmy  gave Danny a what-will-we-fuckin-do look.&nbsp;  She screamed louder and Danny knew what punches sounded like. The heavy  thud of flesh against flesh.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;No.&nbsp; Help.&nbsp;  Help.&nbsp; Rape!</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  automatically took a step but Tam put out a hand &nbsp;&#8212;Leave  it, was all he said.&nbsp; Danny tuned back to  Timmy.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Help,  help.&nbsp; Rape!</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Shut  it ya wee fuckin hoor! </p>
            <p align="left">Another  heavy punch.&nbsp; Lydia&rsquo;s  face at the window pleading.&nbsp; They drag  her back down.&nbsp; A heavy punch.&nbsp; A scream. Danny goes to move again.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  said leave it.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;But.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Get  back to your&nbsp; Lemon Jifs and mind your  own business, Tam said.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">And  he meant it.&nbsp; Then he stood up and went  to the car.&nbsp; Opened the door.&nbsp; All movement stopped. Tam lit a torch and ran  it&rsquo;s beam all over her body.&nbsp; Molesting  her with an obscene pool of light.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Hit  her a slap, he said.</p>
            <p align="left">Somebody  did.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Harder.</p>
            <p align="left">Somebody  did.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;No  Tam please, she said.</p>
            <p align="left">Tam  closed the door and the punching took on a new ferocity.&nbsp; Danny and Timmy moved closer. Danny could  hear exactly what Tam was shouting.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  you doing in here with them ya wee slut?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;They  raped me Tam.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Raped  ye?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a slut.&nbsp; You took them in here.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  didn&rsquo;t Tam honest.</p>
            <p align="left">A  punch.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  didn&rsquo;t Tam honest</p>
            <p align="left">A  punch.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Tam  please.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Right  lads, he said like an order.</p>
            <p align="left">It  was like drums the punching.&nbsp; She  screamed.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Fuck  sake Danny, said Timmy.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Rape!&nbsp; Rape! she was screaming.&nbsp; Banging her fists on the window.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">The  torch sent a series of lurid silhouettes flashing at Danny and Timmy. Danny was  sure her face, caught for a second in the berserk light, was covered in blood.&nbsp; He crept closer. Timmy behind him.&nbsp; Closer they got.&nbsp; Closer.&nbsp;  They were all raping her.&nbsp; Her  face was bruised and bloody.&nbsp; It was only  when they flung her so that her face smeared on the glass that she seen Danny.  And she froze long enough for them to react.&nbsp;  Tam jumped out.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  did I tell you?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  the fuck are yees doing to her?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  did I tell ye? Tam said as he went to the boot.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  can&rsquo;t stand here while youse rape somebody.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;What  did I tell ye?</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  tried to answer but couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;To  mind your own business. </p>
            <p align="left">The  boot&rsquo;s open and there&rsquo;s this almighty roar.&nbsp;  A motorbike coming at them it sounds like.</p>
            <p align="left">But  that&rsquo;s not what it is.</p>
            <p align="left">It&rsquo;s  a chainsaw.&nbsp; Tam lifts it roaring from the  boot.&nbsp; Danny sprints screaming into the  darkness, bumping into Timmy as he does.&nbsp;  He can hear the deafening roar of the chainsaw inches behind. He crashes  into and over a fence.&nbsp; Lands on his  back. Gets up and runs.&nbsp; Hears Tam  clambering the fence and moving in and out the trees.&nbsp; Between the revs he shouts.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Come  back here ya bastard. I&rsquo;m goanny cut ye up!</p>
            <p align="left">It&rsquo;s  heavy going with them big chest wader on.&nbsp;  But Danny keeps moving clump clump.&nbsp;  Running through a puddle.&nbsp; But  keeps going.&nbsp; He can hear Timmy screaming  somewhere and by the cadence knows he&rsquo;s running too.&nbsp; Danny struggles on. The puddle gets deeper dragging  him back.&nbsp; The roar of the chainsaw and  Tam&rsquo;s mad voice closing in. The more the water drags Danny back the more effort  he puts into going forwards.&nbsp; The  chainsaw diminishes but he&rsquo;s not stopping.&nbsp;  Not for nothing he&rsquo;s stopping.&nbsp;  The water gets up to his thighs.&nbsp;  Up to his arse.&nbsp; Up to his  chest.&nbsp; But he trudges on.&nbsp; One leg then the other leg.&nbsp; Then he loses grip.&nbsp; Next thing he&rsquo;s swimming.&nbsp; With the high waders dragging him under.&nbsp; But he swims with the determination of terror.&nbsp; He swims for a long time.&nbsp; And even though it&rsquo;s early summer the water  is freezing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a full half-hour  before he feels rocks and gets some kid of purchase.&nbsp; And all the time the sporadic roar of the  chainsaw and laughing and shouting. </p>
            <p align="left">The  water falls to his chest, his arse, his knees.&nbsp;  He gets out and does a kind of handstand to empty the waders.&nbsp; Gallons cascading out onto his head. Then he  starts running again.&nbsp; Clumping in the  direction this big black shape.&nbsp; Maybe  it&rsquo;s a house, maybe it&rsquo;s a house, maybe it&rsquo;s a house.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s soon on this dark shape.&nbsp; Up he goes steeper and steeper until he&rsquo;s  actually climbing.&nbsp; When he gets so far  and so steep that he can&rsquo;t climb any more he stops. By now the chainsaw has  stopped and he thinks he hears cars moving off.&nbsp;  But he&rsquo;s not going back to check.&nbsp;  He sat shivering. Praying for light. &nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">And  then there&rsquo;s Timmy.</p>
            <p align="left">And  then there&rsquo;s Timmy.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Oh  fuck Timmy.</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  starts crying.&nbsp; Timmy&rsquo;s first time  outside town and this happens.&nbsp; He  pictured Timmy&rsquo;s body parts floating beside the Jif Lemons. Danny dreaded the  coming of light.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">Then</p>
            <p align="left">He  thought he heard something.&nbsp; A sharp  intake of breath.&nbsp; A loose stone rattles  down the slope.&nbsp; Danny grapples about for  a rock.&nbsp; A weapon.&nbsp; Finds a hands sized pebble.&nbsp; And if ever he was capable of murder, that  was the night.&nbsp; He can feel somebody  listening in the dreadful silence.</p>
            <p align="left">Then</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Danny?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Timmy!?</p>
            <p align="left">Timmy  comes scraping down the slope and lands beside him.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Thank  fuck,&nbsp; says Timmy, &#8212;I  thought you were dead.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  thought we both were dead.</p>
            <p align="left">They  hugged each other.&nbsp; Crying for who knows  how long. </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Danny,  said Timmy after a while</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Aye?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  don&rsquo;t want to go fishing again.</p>
            <p align="left">All  their tension came out in laughter.&nbsp; But  they had to stifle it so they giggled like schoolboys till the sun came  up.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s when Danny seen the  puddle he&rsquo;d run through.&nbsp; It was the loch.&nbsp; And across the other side the neds&rsquo; cars were  gone. </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Thank  fuck, said Danny.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Danny?  says Timmy</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Aye?</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;I  can see the Jif Lemons from here.</p>
            <p align="left">And  sure enough away in the distance were these three floats.</p>
            <p align="left">They  made their way down the mountain. Crept round the edge of the dawn loch.&nbsp; A heron flew through the mist.&nbsp; And there was silence.&nbsp; When they emerged from the trees Timmy  spotted the chainsaw drowned in the water.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;Don&rsquo;t  touch it, Danny said, &#8212;Evidence.</p>
            <p align="left">Danny  pulled the rods in one at a time.&nbsp; The  Jif Lemons tilted and headed in.&nbsp; Nothing  on the hooks but nibbled, bleached worms. He packed everything away and made to  the car.</p>
            <p align="left">He  knew there was something different about it.&nbsp;  Everywhere was little crystals of glass. Every window smashed. And  something on the roof.&nbsp; Like a  branch.&nbsp; No, not a branch.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was  a gouge.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">When  they were right up close they realised what it was. The roof was split open  like a tin of beans. The ceiling hung down inside like guts.&nbsp; There was a few gouges on the doors where they&rsquo;d  not been able to cut through.&nbsp; The seats  were shredded and the insides had avalanched.</p>
            <p align="left">&#8212;We  have to go to the cops, Danny said.</p>
            <p align="left">They  shoved the gear in and started up.&nbsp;  Bumped that wreck of a car along the dirt track.&nbsp; It was only when they got to the road and the  wheels started ringing they realised the tyres had been shredded too.&nbsp; Danny screamed.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">The  drove into Kinloch Rannoch with sparks coming off the rims. &nbsp;It was pandemonium on wheels that drew up to  the cop station.&nbsp; But there was nothing  the cops could do. They needed the girl to make a formal complaint. The only  good news was, that even though Danny was third party fire and theft the insurance  office paid out.&nbsp; It was the best story  they&rsquo;d had in years, they said.</p>
            <p align="left">Now,  at nights, way up the highlands, far, far into the wilderness where nobody can  come, Danny sits watching a lonesome Jif Lemon in the knowledge that guys like  that could be anywhere. </p>
