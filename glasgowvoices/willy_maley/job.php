              My father was 53 when I was born. This one is my way of saying I wish I were older or my father had been younger. By the time I was 12 I&rsquo;d lost all my grandparents and my father had turned 65. It&rsquo;s strange now when I see how close my students are to their grandparents, almost like 2nd parents. I found myself wishing after my father died that I&rsquo;d been his friend, though I know that&rsquo;s daft. He&rsquo;d never go to a cafe or bar. He was always either working, walking or at home, reading or wanting peace! I borrowed the title for this poem from Stuart Christie&rsquo;s brilliant memoir, <em>Granny Made Me An Anarchist</em> (Scribner, 2004).

            </strong>(<em>after Stuart Christie</em>)<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Not because he was a fully paid-up<br>
            Card-carrying member of the CPGB<br>
            From the hungry thirties<br>
            Till the walls came tumbling down<br>
            And yes, beyond the beyond<br>
            (He never left the far Left)<br>
            A lifelong activist, International Brigader<br>
            Ex-POW in Spain, soapbox speaker<br>
            From Glasgow Green to Govan Cross<br>
            Who had his little helpers posting<br>
            Leaflets through letterboxes<br>
            On doors scarred by more names<br>
            Than a phonebook<br>
            Into closemouths dark as cellars<br>
            He drove us with cries of:<br>
            &lsquo;Start at the top landing!&rsquo;<br>
            Dogs dogged our faltering footsteps<br>
            Through the tenements of youth<br>
            Nor because he had us<br>
            Into dialectal materialism when other kids<br>
            Were into Daleks and Maltesers<br>
            Or took us to the Socialist Fellowship<br>
            On Fridays, making us miss Mike Yarwood<br>
            Impersonating Wilson and Heath<br>
            With a wig and false teeth<br>
            Or filled the house with left-wing papers, pamphlets,<br>
            Patter, raging at the news, the government, empire, monarchy<br>
            Authority in all its shapes and shadows<br>
            The walls and bars of social norms<br>
            A teetotalitarian intoxicated by ideology<br>
            High on the<em>&nbsp;craic</em>&nbsp;of his Irish father<br>
            Stuck in that wild red neck of the woods<br>
            That we called home, bereft of hope<br>
            But thinking back, that was solidarity<br>
            That handclasp for a broken stranger<br>
            Hunched in a doorway<br>
            The way his father hunched on his arrival<br>
            A hundred years or more before<br>
            Despairing, defiant, clutching his collar<br>
            Yet I remember him walking<br>
            Himself one of nine, later sole survivor<br>
            Father of nine, father of mine, provider<br>
            Not sole, but solitary, pacing<br>
            In solitude through streets paved with gum<br>
            Carrying<em>&nbsp;The Morning Star<br>
            </em>In a hand that would move hot coals around<br>
            The fireplace like chess pieces while we pleaded<br>
            &lsquo;Use the poker, Daddy!&rsquo;<br>
            Stepping, striding, whistling<br>
            Bunnet pushed back, eyes aglitter<br>
            As the evening star stared down<br>
            On dead-end lives of misery and mess<br>
            And I wish I had been, not son<br>
            Or seventh child, as was<br>
            But comrade, friend, supporter<br>
          Of a living cause. </p>            <P></td>
