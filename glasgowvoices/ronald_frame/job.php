            <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Headed notepaper.&nbsp; Nicely done,  and the typeface, Baskerville in blue.&nbsp;  He liked that, the little touches of good taste.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He removed the top of his fountain pen, and paused with the nib held  over the paper.&nbsp; </em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This was going to be the most difficult letter he&rsquo;d ever written.</em></p>
            <p align="center"><em>*</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>20th  October</u></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I put pen to  paper, unaware of how long it will take to find my body.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; After every  grand house I visited, bar two, I wrote a letter afterwards, thanking my hosts  for their hospitality.&nbsp; The Girls  appreciated it: Babe, Slim, Gloria, C.Z.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Although I&rsquo;m  paying for my accommodation here, I feel I ought to supply some notification of  intent: and apologies in advance for the trouble I&rsquo;m bound to cause.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Mea  Culpa&rsquo;.&nbsp; But the real blame belongs to  the bastards, the contemptible low-life little shits, the ones I wasn&rsquo;t going  to mention.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I  could live to read my obituaries.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; WORLD-FAMOUS AUTHORITY ON ... whichever school of Renaissance art they choose to think I most  excelled at.&nbsp; In truth there were so  many.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll use  that photograph of me on Peggy Guggenheim&rsquo;s terrace, with my new beard trimmed  to a point and Venice a riot of life behind me,  apparently two gondolas held in my two raised hands as I engage with the camera  as Dali taught me to.&nbsp; Or at  Zeffirelli&rsquo;s, in my kaftan and fez, smoking a cigar and with the shameless look  of an old roue on my face.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be  something about my obscure origins, before they parade my glories.&nbsp; He worked at this and that gallery before he  went freelance, consulted regularly by the Metropolitan, Uffizi, Louvre,  National Gallery.&nbsp; My books.&nbsp; My performance on &lsquo;Apostrophes&rsquo;, when a  quarter of France went out and bought my latest  title the next day.&nbsp; And then, a  paragraph or two about the controversies in the 80s.&nbsp; The Nazi plunder, and questions about how I  went about establishing their provenance.&nbsp;  Something else about the private patrons of vast fortune who approached  me, wishing to have some work of art in their fabulous collections  authenticated.&nbsp; And nothing, I hope,  about the c**ts who decided, come the new century, let&rsquo;s discredit some of the  giants of the old.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My  philosophy?&nbsp; Oh, very simple.&nbsp; I always had to be better informed and more  cunning than those around me.&nbsp; Sound  supremely confident, and the world will trust you, believe <em>in</em> you.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I became my  own greatest creation.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the  obituaries mention - I doubt it, very much - that I was a perfect house-guest,  ready to sing for my supper.&nbsp; For several  decades I travelled with four trunks, and another five or six bags.&nbsp; (Nothing compared to Marlene, RIP.&nbsp; Or - God help us - the Rex Harrisons.&nbsp; They had fifty, sixty, seventy.)&nbsp; I always had room for my dress kilt.&nbsp; The Campbell tartan, because I long ago  guessed that I wasn&rsquo;t who my mother said.&nbsp;  On her death-bed, although I was six thousand miles away, she started  mumbling about the castle where she&rsquo;d once worked as a girl, in Perthshire,  near a town called Carnbeg, and her sorrow that her son should never know he  was in fact ...&nbsp; At which point, with an  actress&rsquo;s timing, the breath left her body.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; My instinct  for the best art must have come from somewhere: not from her husband, who ran a  newsagent&rsquo;s shop in that Argyllshire lochside town.&nbsp; In her youth she accompanied all the shooting  parties, and even though she was a maid for the ladies, her looks must have  been captivating to the menfolk.&nbsp; Look at  my fingers, see, they&rsquo;re long and slender, finely tapering, van Dyck hands.&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t made for grubbing in some wee  newsagent&rsquo;s; yes, my mother had deft fingers for her seamstress&rsquo;s work later,  but I&rsquo;ve never had any aptitude - let it be written on my gravestone - for  bowing my head, except to deceive.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The true  grandees don&rsquo;t insist on it, only the nouveaux riches.&nbsp; Anyway, it&rsquo;s they who want something from <em>me</em>.&nbsp;  They seek my word on the provenance of their treasures, my yea or  nay.&nbsp; Or sometimes I defer, and resort to  that useful term in Scots law, <em>Not Proven</em>,  which is considerably less than an outright dismissal.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; So now the  hacks, those cretins, they&rsquo;re sniffing blood and baying for me - for <em>me</em>!!&nbsp;  They allege ...&nbsp; What  exactly?&nbsp; That I said &lsquo;yea&rsquo; too often  when I should have said &lsquo;nay&rsquo;.&nbsp; And &lsquo;Not  Proven&rsquo; when I feared that I wouldn&rsquo;t land my hefty fee otherwise.&nbsp; They say I was party to the sale of this item  or that, in New York or London or Tokyo, and that I duly received my  commission (40% at least), sometimes by very devious financial routes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My  philosophy?&nbsp; Oh, very simple.&nbsp; If the owners of those paintings or  sculptures were too stupid to tell the difference between genuine and fake,  then where was the harm?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My  detractors, my slanderers and libellers, they couldn&rsquo;t care less about the  works which I rescued for the world to enjoy.&nbsp;  They don&rsquo;t say a word about the twenty-odd books I wrote.&nbsp; (Who has ever bettered my &lsquo;Florentine  Mannerists&rsquo;?)&nbsp; They conveniently forget  how much hard graft (as well as natural talent) it takes to be a world-famous  fucking AUTHORITY.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; They say they  have proof.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve found documents, referring to  off-shore companies I&rsquo;ve never heard of.&nbsp;  I use Swiss banks, and you pay <em>them</em> interest to guarantee their confidentiality.&nbsp;  I see no reason to distrust that arrangement.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; (2) &nbsp;They say I knew that a certain Bernini or  Raphael or Titian was not in fact as attributed.&nbsp; They first said it twenty years ago.&nbsp; Now some smartarse has been going through my  books paragraph by paragraph, line by line; he&rsquo;s found my lecture notes, buried  in the archives at Cornell and Harvard; he&rsquo;s spent five years of his squalid  little life trawling auction house records.&nbsp;  He&rsquo;s run everything through computers, and, yes, he&rsquo;s set to do a big  piece, a major expose, blah-blah.&nbsp; Some  hotshot agent has come aboard, and Atlantic Monthly and the New Yorker are  fighting to see who&rsquo;ll get it.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck the lot  of them.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; That was the  age of greed that was.&nbsp; Now, in the  terrifying new century, we&rsquo;re so moral.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; They can burn  in hell, burn to ash, before I&rsquo;ll confess anything.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (<u>Note</u>:&nbsp; These low Highland clouds, suddenly parting. = Clouds in  Raphael.&nbsp; Sistine Madonna (Dresden?).&nbsp; Incarnation, Word becomes flesh ----  Transfiguration (Vatican), Christ pierced by the light of  His divinity.) </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A citizen of  the world.&nbsp; Here, there and  everywhere.&nbsp; British when it suited  me.&nbsp; Or American.&nbsp; I woke up in Rome, or Paris, or Madrid, and could never remember where  the goddam pisspot was.&nbsp; I even started  to look a little <em>Russki</em> once the  rouble took over; someone would recognise me at the Negresco - &lsquo;Sink some vodka  with us!&nbsp; Belugia caviare, my friend?&rsquo; -  and it was like Nice a century ago, without the style admittedly, but <em>with</em> the wherewithal.&nbsp; And anyway, I could always go pray for my  sins at their lovely cathedral.&nbsp; Those  saints on the icons, big faces and navvies&rsquo; hands, they could&rsquo;ve knocked you up  a nice little <em>dacha</em> <em>NO</em> trouble.&nbsp; (I once met Matisse, at the Regina at the top of Cimiez.&nbsp; Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know what <em>he</em> said to me?&nbsp; &lsquo;The paintings I hid from view, no one will  see them, but I shall tell <em>you</em> where  they are.&nbsp; Come a little closer &hellip;&rsquo;)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always  had a fear of water.&nbsp; I have a phobia  about bridges maybe.&nbsp; In cities, it  bothers me a little less, where traffic passes, and the pedestrians don&rsquo;t look  threatening.&nbsp; Those metal rat-runs  attached alongside or beneath railway bridges I dislike, I panic; the echoes of  my feet are lost beneath the rumble of trains, and everyone is a stranger, an  illegal alien without a name who looks as if he&rsquo;d whip out a flick-knife and,  just like that, slit your throat. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There is a  bridge here I crossed yesterday, straddling an inlet of the loch.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lonely spot, not a soul in sight, and  the walkway is high over still, dark, deep water.&nbsp; A breeze continually blows, and from either  direction you have to walk against it.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; But I needed  to know where to make my jump.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all,  folks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The  disgraced world-authority&rsquo;.&nbsp; The books  won&rsquo;t get read: why should we believe anything <em>he</em> said?&nbsp; The gilt letters of  my name will be scraped from honours boards.&nbsp;  Maybe I&rsquo;ll be airbrushed out of photographs: those degree ceremonies  where I was capped and received yet another doctorate.&nbsp; (I used to ration myself to how many I  accepted.&nbsp; I took seven, I could have had  fifty, but I didn&rsquo;t want to debase the currency.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The game&rsquo;s up  now.&nbsp; Those students who&rsquo;re writing  theses about me will switch topics.&nbsp; In  the history of art-historians I shall become a comma, a footnote.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be lost in a list of guests at famous  parties, and no one will know I held the floor - that Horst and Beaton  photographed me - and Visconti gifted me a cottage on Ischia - and Onassis asked me what he  should buy for his walls.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll forget  I was the one destined to fit Berenson&rsquo;s shoes (or rather, harem slippers, -  danke schon, Karl Lagerfeld).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I might have  dreamed it all.&nbsp; The dream will pass with  the dreamer, and alas, that will be that.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What is there  to live for?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Schubert&rsquo;s  Eighth is playing on the radio, the Unfinished, and it never sounded so  sorrowful, so dark.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A Tintoretto  indeed.&nbsp; (And who was it wrote - by  common consent - the definitive, most profound account of the making and  meaning of &lsquo;The Finding of the Body of St Mark&rsquo;, Brera, 1562&rsquo;?) </p>
            <p align="center">*</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Later</u>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I came here to kill myself.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I came <em>here</em> because it&rsquo;s near where I was born,  one May.&nbsp; My mother left her job to  return to Carnbeg, because the place was special to her in some way.&nbsp; In those days the August shooting parties  stayed at all the big houses roundabout.&nbsp;  The newsagent, good socialist that he was, had no truck with any of  that, but my mother used to snip gossip columns from the newspapers with her  dressmaking scissors and hide them away, secrete them somewhere, as securely as  any Zurich bank could have done.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Snick, snick,  snick!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I was a  collector myself.&nbsp; But I preferred my  acquisitions <em>LIVE</em>.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Garbo.&nbsp; Judy.&nbsp;  Bette.&nbsp; The two Hepburns.&nbsp; I was there in Marlene&rsquo;s address book -  elastic bands held it together - my name writ in indelible ink, not pencil; she  would call me on her white phone from Paris, once or twice a week.&nbsp; Wallis cooked me her Southern fried chicken  at the royal mill house, several times, but no, she wouldn&rsquo;t give me her  recipe; I called her &lsquo;Your Royal Highness&rsquo;, but she still wouldn&rsquo;t tell  me.&nbsp; Diana stopped off at my apartment,  on the Avenue Montaigne, only hours before the Mercedes came to collect her at  the Ritz.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re  waiting for me, in the haunted Bois de Boulogne.&nbsp;  Jackie too, and Callas.&nbsp; My Ladies  of the Bois.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll drive around, all  night long.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll call on Proust, 102  Boulevard Haussmann: he&rsquo;ll be just rising.&nbsp;  We&rsquo;ll go see Cocteau at Milly-la-Foret.&nbsp;  &lsquo;Je reste avec vous.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be  fun.&nbsp; It will.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t  expecting to see the glory of autumn on the trees - the blaze all along the  shoreline - and its perfect double in the loch, so that the water seems to be  on fire.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; All this  beauty still in the world, it takes my breath away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; As does the  beauty of the boy who sweeps the leaves in the garden.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s seventeen, he told me so when we got  talking.&nbsp; Close to, he has perfect skin,  even though he works out of doors; not a worry line, not even the hint of a  furrow forming.&nbsp; He wants to get into  gardening.&nbsp; Not horticulture but garden  design.&nbsp; He told me in all innocence, and  of course I fell into his thrall, enraptured.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He has  attractive hands, even paler by contrast with the leaves (gold, russet),  fingers which may not be unusually fine or elegant but which suggest  sensitivity.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if  he needs to spend quite so long sweeping that one stretch of lawn.&nbsp; He looks up at the sky every so often, which  allows his eyes to pass the window where I&rsquo;m sitting.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; We may have  reached the fall, but Iain (sic) is filled with the sap of spring.&nbsp; All the vernal delights ooze from him, and  what does it matter if he hasn&rsquo;t heard of Uccello or Piero della Francesca, he <em>will</em>.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell  him, he should postpone doing his gardening course.&nbsp; See the world first.&nbsp; &lsquo;<em>I&rsquo;</em>ll  get you into a college, when you&rsquo;re ready.&nbsp;  The best.&rsquo;&nbsp; They always get their  pay-off like that, once the day comes when they look at you in a different way,  when the respect for you has started to fade from their eyes, when they&rsquo;ve  grown a little bored and they realise they can walk into a room without you and  make other men&rsquo;s heads turn.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; But until  then there may be four or five years.&nbsp;  Meanwhile, I love you, Iain (with 2 i&rsquo;s).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Suicide  letters, I realise, are not my forte.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s easier to write thank you letters to life, I think.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Sudden sun  throws my reflection on to the window glass.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Already my  silver beard has gone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve dyed my  hair, even though I resisted for thirty years.&nbsp;  But needs must.&nbsp; Few would  recognise me now.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I have in  mind a fishing village in Liguria, it slopes steeply down to the  sea, and is like somewhere I felt I&rsquo;d already dreamed when I first went there,  so that it was like stepping back into the familiar.&nbsp; After that, Iain, the Mediterranean will be our succulent oyster.</p>
            <p align="center">*</p>
            <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He replaced the top on his pen, and laid the pen down.&nbsp; (Tiffany, a one-off, courtesy of dear  faithful Mona, Kentucky farm gal metamorphosed into the Countess of Bismarck,  with her Harrison Williams money.)</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He turned the turquoise lacquered barrel with the tips of his  fingers.&nbsp; (Fine, tapering, clear-polished  nails.)</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  He sighed softly, wistfully, experiencing the deliciously mixed torment  and pleasure of the moment.&nbsp; (He was a  man to take all experience as far as he could, to its limits.)</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  From some future point, this would be a memory.&nbsp; He would regain it, with a sense of  triumphant achievement, <u>the moment when</u>.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  (He&rsquo;d never been a tourist of life.&nbsp;  Horst und Helmut and Cecil B. maybe, but he wasn&rsquo;t the sort to need a  photograph of the event to prove he&rsquo;d <u>been there</u>.&nbsp; That presupposed you feared the opportunity  wouldn&rsquo;t recur, and that this was just a fluke, a lucky chance.&nbsp; No, you had to believe in your own worth and  deserving, and then everyone else would too.)</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Travelling north, he&rsquo;d read a famous English journalist, turning against  her own kind.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you noticed, she  asked, that critics always have very mean, tiny mouths?&nbsp; They made her think every time of &lsquo;a cat&rsquo;s  anus&rsquo;.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;  His mirth had exploded in the train compartment.&nbsp; Anxious eyes watched over the tops of  newspapers, mouths shrank.&nbsp; Christ, if  you can&rsquo;t take a fucking joke!</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Then they&rsquo;d hit a long tunnel, and somehow he forgot about the joke,  and gloom-swaddled he foresaw his own tragic, theatrical death by the shores of </em><em>Loch</em><em> Bragar.)</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  CHANGE OF PLAN.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  At the writing desk he watched now as his fingers, stronger than they  looked, started to tear up the letter, into smaller and smaller pieces.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, not too steadily, he got to his feet.&nbsp; A glimpse out of the window.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Iain, posed like the marble Hermes of Praxiteles but (alas) clothed, was  leaning on his broom, waiting for him.</em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  On his clattery way down the wooden staircase he was planning their  route. </em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Firstly, </em><em>Edinburgh</em><em> to </em><em>Paris</em><em> by air.&nbsp; </em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, what?&nbsp; </em><br>
              <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The night &lsquo;Palatino&rsquo; for </em><em>Rome</em><em> left Paris-Gare  de </em><em>Lyon</em><em> at </em><em>7.30 pm</em><em>.&nbsp; Dinner a deux in the restaurant  car - bed if not sleep in the cabin - and they&rsquo;d reach Piazza Principe in Genoa  nine-and-a-half hours after they boarded, nicely in time for breaking day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><br>
