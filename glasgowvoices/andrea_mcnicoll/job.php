            <br><p>Up until last week, I  thought my wife was a prude. I&rsquo;ve never seen her naked - not properly, not in  the light of day. I&rsquo;ve seen all her limbs, of course, and a few other bits here  and there, but never the whole picture. Once, after her sister&rsquo;s wedding, I had  to undress her &ndash; she was really drunk - but even then she had half woken up  when I got to her underwear and had groaned, all stroppy, pushing me away. She  always locks the bathroom door to take a bath. Her swimming costumes are chunky  and old-fashioned: they make her look fatter than she really is. I&rsquo;ve never  known anyone flit so quickly from the changing room into the pool, hands folded  in front of her, eyes staring down at her feet. She&rsquo;s fine once she&rsquo;s in the  water though and swims better &ndash; even faster - than me. </p><p>
Her underwear is dull. She  always chooses the same style: white or black bras and sensible knickers from shops  like Marks and Spencer&rsquo;s. Not that I get to see her in her undies, really,  except for an occasional glimpse through the half-opened bedroom door. In the  early days, I used to try surprising her; I&rsquo;d creep into the room and come up  from behind to take her in my arms while she was dressing but it just upset  her. Then we&rsquo;d both end up apologising. But her underwear does nothing for her.  Sometimes I feel like gathering it all up and burning it. Or stuffing it in the  bin. I&rsquo;d love to see her going without a bra; her nipples showing through a  blouse or tee-shirt. When there&rsquo;s a quiet spell at work I think about things  like that. I daydream about her: she&rsquo;s wandering about the house, standing in  the kitchen, cooking, bending over the washing machine, climbing into the bath.  She&rsquo;s stark naked, massaging my feet. But there&rsquo;s no chance of that with my  wife. </p><p>
It means, you see, that  sex has to be carefully planned. On the couch is out of the question because,  even with the curtains closed, the streetlights shine through the living room  window. Sex outdoors, unless it&rsquo;s night and the skies are overcast (which did  happen once in the early days when we were on holiday in the highlands), is  unlikely. A small chink of light through the bedroom curtains, any suggestion that  the outline of her naked body might be visible puts her off, sends her plunging  back down under the quilt, snuggling up to me for a cuddle, making out she&rsquo;s  too sleepy for anything else. It has to be blackout blinds pulled and lights  out before she&rsquo;ll take off her dressing gown and get under the covers: she&rsquo;s very  strict about the order. I sometimes make jokes about air raids. But when we&rsquo;re  wrapped in darkness and her mood is right, we can really get going. Me: my mood  is always right. But she says it&rsquo;s like she has to forget herself in the dark,  become another person first. </p><p>
She doesn&rsquo;t mind me  wandering around naked though. I leave the bathroom door wide open and she  comes in and sits on the toilet seat, talks away to me, even scrubs my back  sometimes. It&rsquo;s just her own body she can&rsquo;t bear being seen. What&rsquo;s that all  about? She&rsquo;s got a great figure and a lovely face; I see other men looking at  her all the time. What&rsquo;s she got to hide? I&rsquo;ve asked her time and time again  and she just smiles, turns her head away and says, I don&rsquo;t know; I just don&rsquo;t  like my body. </p><p>
Anyway, last week I  decided to take matters into my own hands. It was her birthday. I wanted to get  her something special, something sexy, something that would let her know once  and for all how horny she makes me feel. I went into one of those classy  lingerie shops in the Merchant City, the ones she always pulls me past, shaking  her head, laughing, saying no. I went right in (not the first time, mind you),  had a good nose round. Saw a sweet pair of red cotton pyjamas that she would  have liked but no, I thought, time for a change. She just needs encouragement.  So I looked around at the bras and knickers, the matching sets. There were all  different colours and shapes and I must admit, the knickers slit down the  gusset were really tempting, but I resisted. In the end it was a toss up  between a purple and a red set - quite tasteful, I thought, nothing too wild. I  went for the red in the end because she loves red. I&rsquo;d looked at her old stuff  to find out what size to get. She&rsquo;s a D cup, by the way, which a lot of women  would be proud to show off. The bra was called &lsquo;Gypsy&rsquo;. The red cups were quite  small, considering, woven out of lace, and the label showed the picture of a  dark-haired model with a fantastic cleavage. I could imagine my wife with it  on; she&rsquo;d look great. The panties were thongs: a tiny triangle of lace, one  strap to go round the hips, one to go up the back, diamante butterfly on the  front. I was getting hot just imagining how she would look with them on. It  would work, I thought, smiling to myself&nbsp;  as I took them to the counter to be gift wrapped; once she tried them on  and saw how beautiful she looked she would realise there was nothing to hide.  Not from me, who loved her and wanted her and fancied her more than any other  woman in the whole of Glasgow &ndash; or the world for that matter. </p>
<p>
So, on the morning of  her birthday I got up first and made her some toast and coffee. I even set the  table in the lounge, by the bay window. She came down after me, dressed in my  old blue dressing gown. She looks so small when she&rsquo;s wrapped up in that big  old dressing gown. I gave her the present. I&rsquo;m good with presents usually; I  don&rsquo;t just buy anything. And I&rsquo;m not one of those husbands who  buys the  same favourite perfume over and over again. I really think about what my wife  might like to receive. Last year I gave her a piano; I&rsquo;d hunted high and low  round the Barras, the west end auctions and Clydeside Antiques before I found  the right one. It was art deco &ndash; a Waldemar Berlin &ndash; in walnut. I had it tuned,  bought a stool and everything. She was really touched. She was always telling  me how her mum played the piano when she was little. Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin  - my wife likes all that. Me, I prefer the Artic Monkeys. Anyway, her mum was  supposedly really talented and would practice for hours every evening. Her dad  used to look after her and her sister while their mum practised. He would cook  their meals, iron their clothes and put them to bed. Then her mum started  performing with the Scottish National Orchestra. Sometimes she would be away on  tour for a few nights. She could have been a world famous pianist if things had  worked out differently.&nbsp; But once my  wife&rsquo;s dad left, her mum had stopped playing altogether. Vowed never to touch  the keys again, my wife said. In the end she had sold the piano to a neighbour  down the street. I can still remember the day they came to take it away, my  wife said, and the struggle they had getting it through the doors. As for me, I  used to wonder if her dad left because he was sick of doing all the housework  while her mum played the piano. My wife said no, it wasn&rsquo;t like that. She  hardly mentions her dad, lost touch with him completely when he left. I don&rsquo;t like  asking too many questions.</p><p>
Anyway, I thought there  was a chance I might have hit another winner with the bra and panties. She  picked up the parcel, shook it and pressed it, trying to guess what it was. She  started to pick at the wrapping paper, slowly, carefully; it was nice paper &ndash;  pink with little red rosebuds. When she saw the picture on the box she looked  at me and frowned.&nbsp; Shit, I thought,  maybe this isn&rsquo;t going to work after all. But she opened the box, pulled out  the bra and panties, held them up. Nice colour, she said, thank you, they&rsquo;re  lovely. But she didn&rsquo;t look like she really meant it. She folded them carefully  and started to put them back in the box. If they don&rsquo;t fit, I said, you can  take them back and change them; I&rsquo;ve still got the receipt. Oh, they look the  right size, she said, not meeting my eye, getting up to put the dishes in the  sink. Don&rsquo;t you want to try them on first, I said, following her, putting my  arms round her waist, kissing the back of her neck. I&rsquo;d really like to see you  in them, I said, I think you&rsquo;d look fantastic. She shook her head. Not now, she  said, maybe later. Oh come on, I said, running my hands over the front of the  dressing gown&rsquo;s thick folds, feeling for her breasts underneath. I had a  hard-on &ndash; I pushed against her and let her know about it. Stop it, she shouted,  lifting her arms to get me off. Just leave me be! She ran out the kitchen then,  straight upstairs, into the bathroom and banged the door. Shit. I waited a  minute then followed her, knocking on the bathroom door. Come on, love, I&rsquo;m  sorry, it&rsquo;s your birthday, I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you. I could hear her crying  on the other side of the door. I hate it when she cries - I&rsquo;m useless; I never  know what to say. She wouldn&rsquo;t come out and I had to go to work without shaving  or brushing my teeth.</p><p>
I tried texting her from  work but she didn&rsquo;t answer so I bought some flowers and a bottle of her  favourite red wine on the way home to make up for what had happened. I&rsquo;d pretty  much abandoned hope of ever seeing her in the bra and knickers, but at least I  could fantasize about it. I had booked a table for a meal in an Indian  restaurant. She loves spicy food. She&rsquo;ll order different dishes from the menu  every time. I always play safe and have chicken tikka masala. That&rsquo;s the funny  thing, you see, she&rsquo;s much more adventurous than me. She&rsquo;ll try any kind of  food. She loves going to see foreign films and listens to bands and artists  I&rsquo;ve never heard of. She&rsquo;s always talking about how she wants to go skydiving. So  I guess calling her a prude was a bit unfair, when you think about it. </p><p>
I knew she was in when I  got home because the door was unlocked. I called out her name but she didn&rsquo;t  answer. She wasn&rsquo;t in the kitchen or the living room so I went upstairs. The bathroom  door was open so she had to be in the bedroom. For a second I wondered if she  was going to surprise me, if she&rsquo;d put on the bra and panties after all and was  lying on the bed, dolled up, waiting for me to come home from work. I threw my  jacket over the banisters, loosened my tie and pushed open the bedroom door.  Baby, I said, I&rsquo;m home. She was sitting on the bed alright, but still wearing  my old dressing gown. Her hair was a mess &ndash; she hadn&rsquo;t been in to work or  anything. She didn&rsquo;t even turn round to look at me. What&rsquo;s wrong sweetheart, I asked,  sitting down on the bed next to her. By this stage I was really wishing I&rsquo;d got  those red pyjamas instead. I patted her back and she leaned her shoulder  against me. She kept shaking her head and saying she was sorry, really sorry,  that it wasn&rsquo;t my fault. She had a box of old photographs she&rsquo;d been looking  through, pictures of her on our wedding day, while we were dating, on her  twenty-first birthday, as a teenager, a schoolgirl. There was a cute picture of  her and her sister, all kitted out in their Sunday best - dresses, hair  ribbons, long white socks and black patent leather shoes. Another one showed  them at Hallowe&rsquo;en, dressed up as witches with long pointed hats, making wicked  faces at the camera. Look at this one, she said, holding up a photograph. I  looked at it. She must have been about twelve or thirteen at the time - big  eyes, blonde curls. She was wearing a pair of flared jeans and a purple and  white shirt. I loved that shirt, she said, it was cheesecloth and had little  heart-shaped buttons. You look lovely, I said, even then you were gorgeous. I tried  to kiss her neck but she pulled away. My dad took that picture, she said  slowly, tapping her finger on the photo, we&rsquo;d been out shopping, just him and  me. Mum was away at a concert and my sister had gone to stay with my granny. He  took me into town, said he was going to buy me something really special. We  went into a big department store on Argyle Street, up to the girl&rsquo;s department,  and he let me choose that cheesecloth shirt. I was really pleased. Then he took  me to the underwear department. He said he&rsquo;d noticed I was growing out of my  vests. Time for your first bra, he said, and I said do we have to, can&rsquo;t we  wait for mum. I was embarrassed, you see.&nbsp;  Oh, your mum&rsquo;s too busy, he said, and went up to one of the sales  assistants, asked her to look after me - it was awful. My dad waited outside,  near the lift, while I had to try on all these different bras. The assistant came  right into the cubicle while I was changing. I was mortified. But I had to  choose something. Then she called my dad over and he paid. I started crying on  the way home and my dad told me not to be so silly, anyone would think he&rsquo;d  taken me to the dentists&rsquo;. He said, I know how to cheer you up - I&rsquo;ll take some  pictures of you in your new shirt. You know how much you like dressing up. We  can put them in the album. Run upstairs and put it on. I&rsquo;ll come up when you&rsquo;re  ready and take some pictures. Then he went into the living room and switched on  the telly. I went up to my bedroom, took off my old jumper and vest and put on  one of my new bras. It was white cotton, with a tiny pink bow on the crossover.  I remember looking at myself in the mirror, turning round to the side, thinking  it didn&rsquo;t look so bad after all. I was just about to put my new shirt on over  it when I saw my dad&rsquo;s reflection in the mirror. He must have been standing at  the door all the time. Not yet, he said, pushing the door closed behind him,  don&rsquo;t put it on yet. Let me take a picture of you like that first. </p>            <P></td>
