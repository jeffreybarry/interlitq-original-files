            <br><p>&lsquo;That used to be an island.&rsquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hm?&rsquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;That bit of rock. It used to be an island.&rsquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Off-white foam charges the beach, wearing itself out before reaching the  sand. In the distance, a dog runs tipsy circles round its owner, walking alone.  Charlie looks at Eve as if trying to work out a puzzle, then looks away. His  eyes rest on a rock being washed and washed again by the advancing tide. Taking  a breath first, Eve says:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;They reclassified everything in the 90s. Now it&rsquo;s just a rock.&rsquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Looks like an island to me.&rsquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; After  he speaks, Charlie looks at Eve, not sure if this is just one of the things she  says because she likes the way it sounds. She stares at the clump of rock and  tries to imagine someone standing on it. How big would they be? Every now and  then an angry wave makes the rock disappear &ndash; trying to tidy it up, to start  again &ndash; but it&rsquo;s always still there  when the foam has gone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Further along, they pass the place where they first met, five years ago.  Three tank traps have shifted over time and settled to make a sheltered cove.  The grey concrete cubes are dotted all the way along the beach; a hangover from  World War II when they thought the Germans might invade. As they walk, Eve  watches her feet press the wet sand. Every step makes the colour around it lighten,  bleaching it, like the last suck on a Slush Puppy. She listens to the sound of  her wellies flapping against her calves; it&rsquo;s comforting but somehow slightly  embarrassing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The  suck and pull of the tide labours away with long, asthmatic breaths. Eve looks  back over her shoulder at the tank traps and pushes her hand further into her  pockets. A gull lets out an anguished cry as they step inside a concrete pill  box. Inside, there is an ancient cold. From outside, it appears to slope  ominously, as if making a slow, inevitable descent towards the sea. Eve squints  through the letterbox slat where the soldiers would have pointed their guns;  the sky is overcast but it&rsquo;s still light. Charlie  reaches out, takes hold of her hand. A jag of hard skin by one of his nails  skates over her palm, drawing scribbles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There  was a bonfire the night they met, sheltered in the space between the three tank  traps. Her friend Heather had asked her along; it was Guy Fawkes Night and she&rsquo;d rented a small cottage near Dunbar. Eve remembers the  taste of gritty red wine from a solid plastic mug and the orange glow from the  bonfire on the concrete blocks. When it got dark, Heather&rsquo;s friends set off fifty pounds&rsquo; worth of fireworks that lit up the sky in  shrieks of reds, yellows and greens. It took several attempts to light the  candle inside a gigantic paper lantern, but then it floated away; a red bauble  getting smaller as it headed out to sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The  first time she saw Charlie, he was crouching by the water&rsquo;s edge, skimming stones into the darkness.  Later, when she reached into his pocket, he still had a collection of smooth,  flat stones for skimming. Flashes of light from the fire lit up the back of his  head and his scruffy brown hair made him look somehow childish, his ears poking  out impishly from a hairstyle that had long grown out. He was wearing the  camouflage jacket he later lost in Paris on their anniversary.  At the time, Eve had thought he would be upset - he always wore that jacket -  but instead he was relieved. He was getting bored of it, he said, now he had an  excuse to buy a new one.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Eve?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He  always uses her name when he&rsquo;s  cross with her. Normally, he just calls her &lsquo;angel&rsquo;  or &lsquo;baby&rsquo;, although he&rsquo;s stopped doing that so much lately. &lsquo;Baby&rsquo;: a name he  probably called <em>her</em>, she thinks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Eve?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In bed  he used to call her all the dirty words he knew, strung together in the  darkness as he gathered momentum. Now he just turns on his side, defeated, and  falls asleep. She lies awake beside him and curves out her anger in the  silence, their cold backs almost touching. In the darkness she listens as the  tick from the clock starts up from nowhere, scratching away at the silence,  unsure at first, then gaining in confidence.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Evelyn? Is this about me working next weekend?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Evelyn&rsquo;:  the name her mother used to call her when she was in trouble. A seagull&rsquo;s cry cuts through the November air and is  answered by a dog barking at the water&rsquo;s  edge. The smell of rotting seaweed from along by the headland carries on the  breeze. Beyond the rock, a distant lighthouse starts flashing its warning call.  Charlie gives up trying to drag her into the present and his fingers go quiet,  now just holding her hand. Eve keeps watching the sea.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting  by bonfire Eve had watched, almost hypnotised, as flames jerked manically to  the sound of lively cracks. When she looked up, Charlie was still skimming  stones. Heather followed Eve&rsquo;s  line of sight and told her Charlie&rsquo;s  girlfriend never came to things like this; she was a law student and didn&rsquo;t like getting sand in her shoes or smoke in  her hair. Eve turned to look at the fire, feeling the warmth on her cheeks.  Charlie seemed to hear his name, and came over to ask what they were talking  about. He was holding a packet of sparklers and pointed the open end towards  Eve. He laughed when she put gloves on before taking one and she felt awkward,  not sure whether he thought this was endearing or silly. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Baby?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; She  knows he&rsquo;s looking at her now without  taking her eyes off the sea. An angry gust of wind whips across her face, he  leans in and bangs her shoulder playfully with his. The light is fading,  everything becoming more vague. The beach is empty; the man with the dog has  gone. Further north, another lighthouse starts calling out in the darkness,  answering the first, the two beams in silent conversation with each other.  Faintly, almost imperceptibly, Eve squeezes Charlie&rsquo;s hand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; When the  fire died down and they ran out of dry wood to burn, the boys dared each other  to run across the dozy embers, turning the grips of their trainers bald like old  tyres. It was getting cold and now everyone was sitting, crowded round the  fire. Whenever someone got up, it set off a ripple of accommodating shifting of  feet and legs. Every time this happened, and he had to move, Charlie moved a  little closer towards Eve.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; She was  speaking to everyone but him and could hear her voice rising, giddy. When  Heather stood up, Charlie reached over and took the cigarette from Eve&rsquo;s mouth, taking two long drags before giving it  back. She could feel it on her lips, slightly damp, and noticed her chest  rising and falling in the glow from the fire. Then he opened some marshmallows,  and they took it in turns to melt them on the end of sticks, watching as they  turned to goo behind dark, sooty shells.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On the  walk back to the rented cottage, Charlie linked his arm through Eve&rsquo;s. The darkness and uneven path made her  stumble, and it annoyed her that he might think she was drunk. Halfway through a story about an abandoned bird  she&rsquo;d once rescued, he  pointed to the sky and said:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Orion.&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know.&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Hunter.&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Eve  had always thought it looked more like an acrobat or a clown, and Charlie said,  &lsquo;Depends how you join up  the dots.&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I guess.&rsquo; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Eve, what is it? Tell me, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; She  follows the pattern of freckles on Charlie&rsquo;s wrist, scattered like a constellation and thinks  about touching them. Instead, she reaches down and dusts the sand from her jeans.  In her pocket she can feel the folded paper of the email she found amongst the  debris on his desk. Slowly, she turns to Charlie. He looks old. Beside his  eyes, lines drawn like childish stars crack like ice every time he smiles. She  thinks he might have lost weight, but his eyes are still the same. Something  inside her catches. A sudden shiver of cold taps her shoulder blades, makes her  want to be held.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Baby?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Eve  smiles, nudges Charlie with her shoulder.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yeah?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s getting dark and she can hear the waves break  over the island in front of them, but now it has to be imagined to be seen.  Squinting, she can just about make out the shadow of the tank traps, but  nothing&rsquo;s familiar anymore.</p>            <P></td>
