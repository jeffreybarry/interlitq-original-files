            <p>Word got round that someone'd been appointed and that the man who  got the job was from Derry. It was nothing that would've affected Kenny Ryan.  You wouldn&rsquo;t have expected him to <em>hear</em>. Lo 'n' behold he did but - and one Sunday, after ten Mass, didn't  he pounce on our Liam. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you Mr O'Donnell?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Liam said he was. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'And are you a Derry man,  as people are saying?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Liam said he was. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied, Kenny said he  was too. Was from Derry, originally, an' all. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're kidding?! What's your  name? I'd be lying if I said I recognised ye - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Even when Kenny told him,  our Liam couldn't place him. The only Ryans he knew were from Cable Street -  and he couldn't see this boy being anything to themmins. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He said to Kenny to come  down for his dinner anyhow. The boy, after all, was on his own. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'What now?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course, now! - Just  come down. There's more than enough to go round!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Kenny relented and they  turned to go. Had hardly reached the kirk but before Liam'd to stop to clarify  something. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'On one condition: it's <em>Liam</em>, Kenny. Forget the <em>Mr  O'Donnell </em>- ' </p>
            <p>The dog growled, baring his teeth, when Kenny first walked in. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'That's enough of that,  you!' - Liam hit him a slap. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget, hearing a  stranger, took a quick look in from the kitchen. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is my wife, Bridget  - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Kenny's from Derry  originally an' all,' Liam told her. 'He's a Ryan. Nothing to the ones on Cable  Street but! I said we&rsquo;d give him his dinner!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget said, 'Aye &ndash; no  bother!' and shook Kenny's hand. 'Nice to meet you, Kenny!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Next job to do was  introduce the weans: from Liam down to wee Orla. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Seven, you have?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Kenny made some comment  their da shrugged off: &lsquo;It's right enough what they say, sure &ndash; it's cheaper by  the dozen!&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Annette was clinging to  the dog still. There was still the odd angry growl. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cut that out, you!' Big  Liam warned. 'Or it's another slap you'll be gettin!' </p>
            <p><em>How long are you over in Scotland?</em> wasn't straightforward in Kenny's case. He'd  been <em>back </em>in Scotland for  the last ten years. Was out of Derry <em>over thirty</em>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>All over</em>, the boy had been: Pakistan, India, - you  name it. <em>Walking</em> everywhere,  too!&nbsp;&nbsp; First few times he was down, he  was always on about Turkey. Seems there was nowhere in Turkey Kennyboy didn't  know, not that the same one was for letting on how come. He took great delight  in describing the massages: how you lay face down and a boy walked up you,  footing it up your spine. Seeing our Liam looking sceptical, Kenny got up to  demonstrate - taking dainty wee footsteps towards the fire. 'You'd be  surprised,' he insisted, 'what good it does!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He could've been Turkish  himself, nearly, Kenny. Had a face that was made for a skull cap, that  wouldn't've stood out in a bazaar. There was something about his colouring an&rsquo;  all, that dated back to his travels maybe. The main thing about him but was:  how incredibly <em>neat</em> the boy was. He maybe wasn't the tallest of  men, was a great one but for a suit. His shoes ye could see yer face in. His  hair, never long, he always brylcreemed back. He was wild well-spoken for a  factory worker. In fact: ye'd never've known he was Derry born 'n' bred, if he  hadn't told ye himself. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The boy was thon way, it  was hard to say what age he was. He must've been fifty at least but, when he  first turned up in the house. Not that the same one looked it. No, Kenny Ryan <em>looked  after himself</em>. Or <em>looked</em> lik he did. Which is why the O'Donnells were all so shocked when  he said where he bought all his clothes from. Every bloody stitch was from the Barras. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're not telling me you  buy your <em>shoes</em> there an' all?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; For once, our Liam was  speechless. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do,' Kenny confirmed.  'Why wouldn't I?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He took one off and handed  it over. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Big Liam was giving it: '<em>Clothes</em>, I can imagine. Clothes, you can wash or  dry-clean. I couldn't see myself wearing second-hand <em>shoes</em> but,' when Kenny interrupted him. 'Inspect  them then!' he demanded &ndash; ye could tell but his feelings were hurt but. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'The best of leather!' he  insisted as Liam read the writing. 'Leather soles <em>and</em> uppers. - An old shilling, they cost me!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can't argue wi that!'  Liam conceded. </p>
            <p>Sunday dinner became a regular occurrence. Before too long, it was <em>weekly</em>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The weans would look  forward to him coming. To begin wi, sure, they were <em>curious</em> - and he did, after all, bring them sweets. Saying that: it was  well seen Kenny'd no weans of his own. Week after week, his <em>varieties</em> started a riot, nearly.  Would've done, probably, if it hadn't've been for Liam &ndash; Big Liam. 'Yous know  what'll happen, if I catch yous fighting!' he'd warn. 'The whole buckin lot'll  go in the bin!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Say <em>thank you</em> to Mr Ryan!' he'd then insist as the Flake,  Aztec, Mars bar etc went off in separate directions. </p>
            <p>It must've been after the clothes conversation Kenny first turned  up on a Saturday - on his way <em>back </em>from the Barras. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He plonked a strange  purchase down in the middle of the floor. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does anyone know what  that is?' he asked the assembled O'Donnells. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Haven't the foggiest!'  our Liam admitted as the weans all shook their heads just. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The one thing they did  know was: that this was bloomin boring. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it from the inside of  a machine?' Sean asked. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Could it be part of a  broken lawnmower?' - Ciara sounded confident. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Kenny said no to both, cut  poor wee Cahal short. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're approaching it all  wrong!' he insisted. 'No more guesses! Ask me questions&nbsp; to try and narrow it down. Do you know <em>Twenty  Questions</em> on the  wireless? The first question&rsquo;s always: <em>is it animal, vegetable or mineral</em>? That's how to start. <em>Animal,  vegetable or mineral </em>- and  take it from there...' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The weans were out of  their depth, weren't in the least bit interested. Kennyboy was lucky if he got  to Question 3. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just <em>tell us,</em> Kenny!' the Wee Ones pleaded. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He wasn't for giving in  but, insisted they'd to guess. Yet more proof it was: the boy was useless wi  weans. One by one they wandered off just - leaving Kenny alone wi the dog. And  his unidentified mysterious bloody object abandoned just on the floor. </p>
            <p>It was <em>every </em>Saturday evening after that. Every Saturday night and Sunday  lunchtime. Bridget, fed up <em>managing</em>, started to count him in. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He appreciated her, Kenny,  at least. Week after week, he brought her a Fry's Cream - handing it over lik  he was giving the woman gold. A running joke, it became: that Kenny Ryan  idolised her. To be fair: there was nothing the same boy wouldn't have done for  our Liam's Bridget. Anything that broke, Kenny fixed. Cassette recorders, hair  driers, you name it. The weans&rsquo; trannies. The record player. He saved them a  fortune in repairs! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Be that as it may: Bridget  was still at her wit&rsquo;s end when Kenny started coming a third night. Wednesday  was his half day, he revealed, and always he would go to Paddy's Market. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturdays  &amp; Sundays - the Barras <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesdays  - Paddy's Market <br>
              The smell, the <em>dirt,</em> off the stuff was unreal - and Bridget would be cooking the tea  too! And it wasn't as if Liam was home to entertain him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget, as ye might  imagine, was completely browned off. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The weans, God love them,  had their homeworks to do. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; One time Bridget looked  in, Kenny was playing wi the dog. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Even the buckin dog showed  no reaction. </p>
            <p>It was Young Liam who started to ask questions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Annette &amp; Ciara were  in on it an' all. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'K.R.' they'd started  calling him. Not to his face but. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; At 15, 14, 13, they were  starting to have minds of their own, and Kenny'd made the mistake of totally  offending them. It was one night the News was on, and somewhere in America, a  boy was due to be executed. Was the first our Liam&rsquo;s weans had heard of Death  Row - and the girls &amp; young Liam were appalled. Kenny but, needless to say,  was all for it. For Kenny, the electric chair was <em>too good for the boy</em>. Kenny&rsquo;d've cut his hands off &ndash; lik they done  in countries lik Turkey. Thrown him into a cell and left him to rot. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'I take it you're in  favour of bringing back the birch?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Young Liam was fizzing. Ye  could hear it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am!' Kenny insisted.  Bugger wasn't for budging. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Listening </em>to the guy was bad enough. The day the boy was  executed but, the lousy shite &quot;dropped by&quot;. <br>
  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropped by</em>, their arse! There was no way, that night,  the weans could be polite. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; It was Annette who gave  the signal &ndash; and off they headed. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'That boy's pure sick!'  she hissed. 'That's what he is: sick!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'He's a slimey oul  so-and-so!&rsquo; &ndash; Ciara. &lsquo;Don't be upsettin yourself, Annette - he's not worth it.' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who's <em>he</em>, like, to judge?' Liam suddenly gave it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever way Ciara  reacted, a penny'd just dropped. <em>This </em>was what Miss Rafferty was always stressing: you had to <em>think  critically</em>; had to be <em>willing  to challenge</em>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Something in Annette's  face was urging Liam on. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'What I want to know is <em>why</em>?' he said. 'Why's he not married? Why's he no  family?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why's nobody heard of  him?' - Annette. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why'd he leave Ireland?'  - Liam again. 'Why India and Turkey? Why bloomin <em>walking</em>?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What age d'ye think he  is?' Ciara interrupted. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't know. -  Fiftysomething? Dad's in his forties, sure!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ciara'd got Liam thinking:  'Born in 19twentysomething, that would make him. So: 19 or 20 when the war  ended...' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'D'ye think he was a  soldier?' - Annette. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can't see it,' - Liam.  'The Navy, if anything.' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'So he went to all them  countries <em>after </em>the war?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Reckon so. I can see him  walkin 'n' walkin - I can't see him <em>fightin</em> but. Can <em>you</em>?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The girls shook their  heads. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'So that was the 1950s and  then he came to Scotland?' - Ciara. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would add up, aye - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wonder what the reason  was? How he didn't go back to Ireland?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; They were onto something,  it felt lik. And getting a bit of revenge for the guy on Death Row. </p>
            <p>Their da, it turned out, had been asking questions an' all. Had  been <em>putting out feelers</em> whenever  he phoned Derry. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; None of their aunts 'n'  uncles had ever heard tell of Kenny. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Their gran 'n' all her  pals had never heard tell of him either. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Christy, an uncle <em>by  marriage</em>, it was, who  finally came up wi the goods. Karate and amateur boxing were the crucial  connection. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Karate, you could see.  He&rsquo;d that kind of frame, Kenny. <em>Boxing</em> was hard to imagine. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; It was the <em>training </em>that appealed, he told our Liam. It kept you  off the street and out of trouble. 'And there was no shortage of trouble back  in those days!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Running up Rosemount <em>backwards</em> was what Kenny minded most. Murder, he said it was. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'But a heck of  a lot better than getting <em>involved</em>.' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; ('He means<em> the IRA</em>,' Liam'd to explain to his sisters.) </p>
            <p>It wasn't long after that conversation Christy was back on the  blower. He'd <em>more </em>information.  This time, even better. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On three different  occasions, he told them, Kenny'd been due to get married. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And on three different  occasions, he'd jilted the girl at the altar. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Three bloody times, the  so-and-so failed to show. <em>That</em> was why he scampered, Christy'd discovered: the &quot;boys&quot;  were after him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; (&lsquo;No, not his fiancee&rsquo;s  brothers,&rsquo; Liam explained this time. &lsquo;The <em>Provos</em>!&rsquo;) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There was more! Two of  Kenny's cousins lived in Derry still. An aunt did an' all. All three were  women, ages wi Kenny maybe. <em>Delighted </em>they were, to have found him. <em>K</em><em>een as anything</em> to meet  him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'They're after his buckin  dough,' said Uncle Christy &ndash; who knew about the money down the cushions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Our Liam, being our Liam,  invited the three of them over. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell them they're very<em> welcome</em>,' he told Christy to tell them. 'Any time  they lik! They're more than welcome in our house!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There wasn't a hope in  hell of <em>Kenny</em> issuing  invites. <em>That</em>, our Liam  didn't have to be told. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The boy had a room 'n'  kitchen, it seems. Single-storey, mid-terrace, bit of a garden to the front.  His own front door, at least, as the two Liams told us. What the problem was  was: it was crammed full wi junk. A mini-Barras, lik. <em>Four </em>bloody motorbikes, seemingly, were parked  round the room. His bed folded down from the wall. Stuff was piled high  everywhere, the shelves all full round the walls. You'd to jump over a hole to  get into the kitchen. The toilet was off that again. Big Liam even turned down  a cuppa even - after seeing the state of the dishcloths. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing to come  out that day was: Kenny Ryan had <em>rats</em>. He'd hear them - imagine! - at night and - and fling a buckin  hammer at them. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On one famous occasion, he  split one's head open. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the big reunion  but: Kenny, when he got wind of it, was raging. So buckin raging, he couldn't  begin to disguise it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Liam's three oldest were  rubbing their hands in glee - <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'NO WAY, Liam!' Kenny  roared. 'I <em>don't</em> want to see  them.' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'It&rsquo;s too late, Kenny!'  their da informed him. 'The ladies are already on their way. I don't know what  you're worrying about, anyhow. You can meet them here, if you lik...' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The fact it wasn't at his  place seemed to help. </p>
            <p>The evening, in the end-up, passed without incident. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Not wanting to miss  nothing, the weans ensured they were in. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Lik <em>This Is  Your Life</em>, it was! 'All  the way from Londonderry, it's your cousins, Annie &amp; Rosie - and your aunt,  Deirdre!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There was a strained  politeness. The ladies - middle-aged, overweight, all done up in their corsets  - were given the settee. Kenny, the closest armchair. The O'Donnells watched  lik hawks until finally, <em>eventually</em>, Kenny &ndash; &ldquo;K.R&rdquo;. -  <em>thawed</em>. The ladies,  all smiles, suggested a photo. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Our Liam took some that  Kenny even smiled for &ndash; he even squeezed in between his cousins even. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The strain there was  before had gone. The strange politeness stayed but. </p>
            <p>Christy 'n' our Liam'd never had so much to talk about. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There was one last thing  Liam was desperate to know. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would you say it was  okay, Christy, to leave him in charge of your house?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'What were you thinkin  lik, Liam?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, we're due to be  over home for three weeks - and the last  couple of times, I put the dog in the kennels. I could save a tiny fortune if Kenny house-sat. Wha' d'ye think? Should I ask him?'<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, he wouldn't run off  wi yir daughters, that's for sure!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; '<em>They're</em> coming with me 'n' Bridget. So, too, are the  boys - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, seriously, Liam: I  think you're okay. I'd say he's straight 'n' honest. No-one I've spoken to has  suggested any different - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye, you're probably  right, Christy. Speakin of which: did I tell ye the story from his work?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't think so. Though ye  said he was working, aye - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll have to tell you  about his pay-packets before I hang up! Seems he went in to work one Monday  there and the foreman was calling him for everything. They'd overpaid him on  the Friday, and he'd not had the decency to say. Kenny took so much of it, it  seems, before &ndash; finally &ndash; he erupted. <em>The reason I haven't said anything is I've yet  to open the envelope</em>, he told them. <em>Expect me  to believe that</em>? the foreman  sneered. <em>You will</em>, Kenny told him  and stormed out. First thing next morning, he's up at the office, handing back  their pay packet. <em>YOU open it</em>, says Kenny. <em>YOU check it</em>. And here - before the boy can do anything, he takes out a second  envelope. And a third and a fourth and a fifth, - every single one of them  unopened. <em>Nine </em>there were on  the table, apparently, before Kennyboy was finished - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take it he got an apology?'  Christy pretended to ask. 'Give him the keys of your house, Liam!' </p>
            <p>Soon after that, the O'Donnells were over in Derry. The story of  Kenny's pay packets had beaten them to it. Was just as buckin well the guy had  fled to Scotland. The whole o bloody Derry wanted to burgle him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The call came on the  Monday - before the weans had settled even. Kenny phoned their Gran's, to speak  to their da. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's the dog,' Liam  announced, coming back in from the hall. 'Wrecked the buckin house, he has - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Annette's face dropped.  There was nothing the wean could do but. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'When Kenny got back last  night, the place looked lik a bomb had hit it. The two curtains were down and  so was the pelmet. The very bit of wood the curtain-rail was nailed to was  snapped in two... ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'That wasn't a bomb, Liam!  Sounds more lik an Army job to me! Ye sure ye weren't raided?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Liam glared at the  jokester. 'I can do wi'out the wise-cracks, nephew!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He turned to Bridget. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'The settee's ripped to  shreds, love. We&rsquo;ll need a whole new suite - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget didn't speak. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Labradors!' Liam cursed.  'Don't any of yis ever get one! That's the third buckin settee I'm having to  buy!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what about   Shamrock,  Dad?' Was Annette dared to ask. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's into the kennels wi  him. I told Kenny to take him - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'What else was I supposed  to say?' he protested, spotting Bridget's reaction. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you want the good  news?' he went on. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget nodded. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'He's caught the mouse - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have yis a mouse?'  someone asked. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not any more!' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'How'd he catch it, Dad?'  - Sean. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'He used chocolate  biscuits - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thought so!' - Sean  again. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'He crushed up a  digestive, seemingly, and mixed it wi Polyfilla - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jesus, Liam! -<em>Where</em>'d he get <em>that</em> recipe?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's what he gives his  rats!' the weans chorused. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Was either that or the  flying hammer, it seems. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'The Polyfilla sets in  their stomachs,' Sean explained. 'The weight of it slows them down and they  can't get back out through the holes - ' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; '<em>Someone</em>'s been paying attention!' Christy laughed.  'D'ye pay attention lik that when you're at school?' </p>
            <p>The three weeks flew past just. Suddenly it was time to go back. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget's heart sank when  she saw the state of her kitchen. He hadn't lifted a finger, Kenny hadn't.  Hadn't bothered his arse at all to clean. The same plate and cup had been used  for three weeks. Same bits of cutlery an' all. The bottle of <em>Fairy  Liquid</em> had taken root. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The bedroom Kenny slept in  was even worse. Bridget had cleared the older girls&rsquo; bedroom specially,  seemingly. Fixed it up nice. It was the <em>smell</em> that hit her first, she said, when she went to change it back. The  window&rsquo;d not been opened in all them weeks. Nor had the dirty bugger changed  the bed. The pillowcase was clatty wi&nbsp;  Brylcreem, apparently. St Veronica&rsquo;s veil or the Turin shroud  wouldn't've had a look in. She'd ended up burning the pillowcase, Bridget. Two  of her best sheets an' buckin all. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Her one consolation was:  there was no more bloody mouse. </p>
            <p align="center">*** </p>
            <p>Fast-forward thirty years. Our Liam, God rest him, is four years  dead now. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Kenny&rsquo;s been gone ten, &ndash; <em>at buckin  least</em>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; His house - would ye  credit it? - is lying empty. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ye'd think someone would  do something. That someone would be responsible. But <em>no </em>but. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Rottin away it is. You  wouldn't buy in the street even. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; All thon stuff from the  Barras is probably in there an' all still. Stuff he always insisted he'd  re-sell. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the bloody stuff  he never fixed. </p>
            <p>At some point - in the eighties maybe - Kenny's visits stopped. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; By that stage, boyfriends  'n' girlfriends were in an' out of the house, sure. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it felt too crowded.  Maybe he felt neglected. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; However thick-skinned, he  maybe picked up vibes maybe. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; His visits dried up anyway  - <em>whatever </em>the  reason. </p>
            <p>The last years of his life he spent <em>caretaking</em>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A caravan site it was -  and he'd no sooner started work there than he started to sleep in his office. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; To cut down on the travel,  he said. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'To save the flippin bus  fares!' the O'Donnells chorused. </p>
            <p>A good ten years maybe, he lived lik that. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There were nights wi winds  'n' rains when ye couldn't help thinking of him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; There was no call for it  either: the whole buckin time, he'd thon wee house still. <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
              Not long after his da died, young Liam fancied a walk one day &ndash;  round the dam and up the Braes, lik he'd liked to walk in his teens. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget, to his delight,  said she'd join him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On their way back, they  were, when they passed K.R.'s street. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you mind, Mum, what  number he was?' <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Bridget didn't - not that  it took them long to find it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Liam or Bridget  said anything. They both just stopped just. The garden <em>screamed</em> neglect, it seems. Animal, vegetable, mineral - it was all there.  Pigeons 'n' seagulls were picking at somebody's vomit. The carcass of a bird  lay at the door. What looked lik a rag-tree was taller than the house, got. The  weeds 'n' nettles had completely taken over. The guy's power-box, even, had  slowly rusted away - its front prized open, the wiring now in shreds. The house  itself had <em>slumped,</em> apparently -  the FOR SALE sign barely upright behind a broken pane. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Liam, seeing this, could  imagine the rats now just <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He turned to Bridget to  say so. Her head, but, was lowered. Her hands joined in prayer. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'You alright, Mum?' he  asked once she finished. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; She nodded. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 'May God rest his soul,'  she said. Then turned to head home. </p>
