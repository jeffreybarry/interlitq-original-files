            <br><p>Mammy  said I&rsquo;d ruin my eyes, reading under the covers wia torch but I didnae  care.&nbsp; I was obsessed.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sneaked the Famous Five under my  sums jotter, took them out tae read at playtime when everyone else was skipping  or playing tig.&nbsp; Every Saturday I was  first at the library, pestering Miss Lafferty for a new book, every night I  fell asleep imagining my life was like theirs.&nbsp;  We stayed in a street of identical houses, visited my granny on a Sunday  and went to Girvan for a week&rsquo;s holiday in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nae country lanes or remote islands tae  explore, nae adventures wi circus kids or smugglers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one Saturday morning just as I  was about to escape to the library Mammy said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve booked wur holiday.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to a caravan this year.&rsquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;A caravan?&rsquo; My mind instantly filled  with an image of a brightly painted wooden contraption, pulled by an old  horse.&nbsp; I hugged her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;A caravan?&rsquo;&nbsp; Alan, my brother, who, since he&rsquo;d turned  thirteen,&nbsp; had been cultivating a long  droopy sweep of hair which covered his permanent sneer of disgust.&nbsp; &lsquo;God.&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammy ignored him, disentagled my arms  which were wrapped round her neck. &nbsp;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t strangle me, Katie.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  thought it&rsquo;d be a nice change.&nbsp; Fresh  air.&rsquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seemed to be allergic to fresh air  nooadays, spent all his time in his bedroom, plugged intae heidphones wi the  curtains drawn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;When will we get the caravan?&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammy looked confused for a minute  then said,&nbsp; &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t be coming here, hen  - it&rsquo;s at the caravan park. We&rsquo;ll go there on the bus.&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan sloped out the kitchen without  saying a word.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Looks like a field fulla giant  elasterplasts.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far my da had been  showing about as much enthusiasm for the caravan holiday as Alan.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d stared out the windae of the bus,  ignoring Mammy&rsquo;s attempts tae include him in conversations about the weather  and the beauty of the coastline but when the rows of identical flesh-coloured  metal boxes came intae view he exploded.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what persudaded you,  Eileen.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be squashed thegether like  sardines, next tae heaven only knows whit kinda folk.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammy said nothing but her fingers  tightened round the message bag perched on her knee.&nbsp; I felt a sinking feeling replace the tingle  of excitement that had filled my belly since I woke up that morning.&nbsp; Even though a caravan park that you went to  on the bus wasnae the same as a caravan you drove through the countryside,  stopping to ask a farmer to let you stay in his field, it was still different  fae living in a house.&nbsp; But with my daddy  moaning, Alan sulking and Mammy upset, it didnae look as if it was gonnae be  much of a holiday.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the caravan I cheered up.&nbsp; There were bench seats, wee windaes to look  out, a cooker wia cover you could use as a worksurface, everything you needed,  all in miniature.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;Stop turning the tap on and off, Katie.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll waste the water in the tank.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I skipped round the van. There was a  closed off bit at one end which had a wee double bed in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you and Daddy are in there where will me  and Alan sleep?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The seat makes up intae two beds,&rsquo;  said my mammy.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put up the tent.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be far too cramped in here for us all,&rsquo;  said my da.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a few moments I could barely  contain mysel for wondering which would be better, being in a the caravan or in  the tent, but my da decided it&rsquo;d be best for him tae sleep by hissel in the  tent, which he pitched at the side of the van. &lsquo;Safer that way.&nbsp; You never know who&rsquo;s about.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night, after a tea of  sausage and egg, us all squashed round the fold-up table, I drifted off to  sleep in the bed next to my mammy, dreaming about what the next day would  bring.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              The  beach was a five minute walk through the sand dunes, tan-coloured sand with a  fringe of crunchy seaweed near the shoreline, and though it was only ten  o&rsquo;clock, families were already clumped across it.&nbsp; We set up camp in the cleft of some rocks.&nbsp; Mammy spread out the tartan blanket and  covered it wia beach towel and my da constructed a shade out of an auld  umbrella weighted doon wi stones.&nbsp;&nbsp; It  was a lovely day - bright, wia breeze blowing in fae the sea - and I was in  heaven.&nbsp; I spent ages building a castle  wi my bucket and spade. &nbsp;Me and Alan used  tae make them thegether, but the day he pulled on a perra shades and sat a few  feet away fae us starin out tae sea.&nbsp; Da  helped me with the castle for a while, digging a moat round the big pile a damp  sand I&rsquo;d collected, then went tae sit next to Mammy on the blanket, her reading  her book, him daeing the crossword. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the castle was done, I went doon  tae the shore where my plastic beach shoes made ridged footprints in the damp  sand.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hunkered doon and stared.&nbsp; Close up I could see how the sand wasnae  actually sand coloured at all but made of different particles, some black, some  bleached and some orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; I poked my  finger in it, curled it round in a spiral, then stopped, horrified.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d almost touched a blobby, squelchy  jellyfish. It wasnae that big but it was yuchy, misshapen wi purple veins  threaded through it.&nbsp; I ran up the beach.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a jellyfish on the beach!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My da looked up fae his paper. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll  no dae you any harm, just be careful.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wear your shoes when you go in for a  paddle,&rsquo; added Mammy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked fae one to the other.&nbsp; I didnae want to go back by mysel.&nbsp; It wasnae just that I was feart of getting  stung, but there was something about the shapelessness of the thing, the way it  had nae features, looked as if it&rsquo;d been squeezed out of some gigantic tube and  left there, dripping on the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp; My  da sighed and pushed hissel to his feet.&nbsp;  &lsquo;C&rsquo;mon, hen,&rsquo; he said and took my haund.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We examined it thegether.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why does it look like that,  daddy?&nbsp; Why does it no have a face?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an early form of life, like  amoebas and that. They&rsquo;re no as developed as the creatures that came later,  insects and birds.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved along a few feet to a wee  pool. Tiny beasties skimming the&nbsp; glitter  of seaweed and salt water.&nbsp; Above in the  blue sky a seagull hung on a current of air.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My da gestured to where a group of  children were playing with a beach ball, jumping in and out of the water.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and make pals?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t want tae.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Alan does his dying duck act while  you go all shy on us.&nbsp; A caravan holiday  will be good for the children says your mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some holiday.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned and heided up the beach, past Mammy  and Alan, back towards the site. </p>
            <p>The  famous five went tae a farm for their food. The farmer&rsquo;s wife gied them cheese  and ham and eggs fae her chickens.&nbsp; We  went to the site shop, a low building made of corrugated iron near the main  gates to the park.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;You help your daddy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sort the washing. Mammy gied me the list  and we set out across the grass.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Can I go round with the trolley?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Aye on you go, hen.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Da stationed hissel near the counter  where a blonde wumman was sitting, flicking through a magazine. She lifted her  heid and smiled at him.&nbsp; &lsquo;That your wee  lassie?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s your double.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shop wasnae that big but there  were two long rows of shelves and I wandered up and doon, putting in tinned  meat, bread, bacon and kitchen roll.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went up to the counter.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Da, there&rsquo;s nae fruit or veg.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s tins round the back of that  shelf,&rsquo; said the wumman. Close up I could see the way she pencilled in her  eyebrows, very dark in contrast wi the blonde hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;We only have fresh stuff on a Thursday when  the van comes.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;OK.&rsquo;&nbsp;  I set off again, filling the trolley with tinned peaches, pears and&nbsp; peas.&nbsp;  &lsquo;I was glad I wouldnae be made to eat apples or oranges.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammy wasnae too chuffed with the bag  of messages we brung back.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d think  they&rsquo;d have a few bits of lettuce or some tomatoes for salad.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Folk probably cannae be bothered on  holiday,&rsquo; said my da.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather stayed sunny and days  settled intae a routine.&nbsp; Mornings we&rsquo;d  have toast and cornflakes then heid doon the beach, return tae the caravan at  lunchtime.&nbsp; Afternoons we split up. Alan  had made pals wi another boy, Gary his name was, wore black fae heid tae  toe.&nbsp; There was a putting green nearby  and they hung about there every efternoon though they never done any putting.  Mammy usually had a lie doon while I read my book, cooried in among the sand  dunes.&nbsp; I loved that time, lost in my  story, coming to noo and then tae glance across at the big sky and birling  white clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Da went aff on his ain, binoculars  round his neck.&nbsp; I asked to go wi him but  he wasnae for it.&nbsp; &lsquo;You keep your mammy  company.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That first day he was only away for an  hour, returning with a loaf and some cheese. &lsquo;Picked it up on the way back,  saves gaun out later,&rsquo; he said, placing it on the table.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; said Mammy. &lsquo;Where did you  get to?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh just a wander.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fancy a game of putting, wee yin?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My daddy&rsquo;s wanderings took him further  afield as the week drew on and he didnae came back till tea time, but he was  cheerier, stopped moaning about being in the caravan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes he&rsquo;d bring a few cans of beer or a  bottle of wine back with him as well as the food.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved mealtimes round the wee  plastic table.&nbsp; Mammy complained that the  shop wasnae very good but I thought it was great having fry ups and boiled eggs  and beans on toast, eating tinned fruit instead of fresh.&nbsp; After tea we&rsquo;d go for a walk along the beach  then heid back and play cards or ludo as the sky darkened outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Thursday after lunch,&nbsp; Mammy and me were washing up the dishes at  the wee sink. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only two sleeps and one and a hauf days left,  Mammy.&nbsp; I wish we werenae gaun hame on  Saturday.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d lost count of the days - which  reminds me ...&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I need to go to the shop and get some  fresh fruit and veg - the delivery&rsquo;s today.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;ll get some on his way hame.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;By then there&rsquo;ll be none left.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She threw on her anorak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sky&rsquo;s turning - hope it doesnae start tae  rain.&nbsp; You stay and finish the dishes -  I&rsquo;ll no be long.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dried the dishes and put them away  in the neat cupboards above the bunk.&nbsp; I  loved daeing housework in the caravan,&nbsp;  used tae imagine I was Anne waiting for George and the rest to come back  fae the farm.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;d finished I sat on  the bench and looked out the windae. Spits of rain settled on the glass,  getting heavier and heavier.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned round when I heard her at the  door.&nbsp; Mammy&rsquo;s anorak was dripping wet  and her hair stood round her heid in frizzy damp curls.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the messages?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh ... the shop was ... shut.&rsquo; She  hung her anorak on the peg, standing with her back to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and have a lie doon, Katie.  You read your book, hen.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shut the door of the wee room  behind her and I returned to the world of smugglers&rsquo; coves and lost doubloons.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              When  my daddy returned he placed a bag on the table.&nbsp;  I opened it and spread out the contents; tomatoes, lettuce, bananas. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammy rinsed the tomatoes in the sink.  &lsquo;So the shop was open later then?&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;&nbsp;  Daddy cracked open a can.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Lucky you didnae get soaked this  afternoon.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lifted the paper. &lsquo;Took shelter for  a while.&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had salad and hard boiled eggs for  tea that night.&nbsp; It was too wet to go for  a walk and the rain battered doon on the roof of the caravan as we played snap.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I think we should just go hame the  morra,&rsquo; said Mammy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, Mammy.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nae point staying if it&rsquo;s  gonnae pour all day, hen.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be as  well in your ain house.&rsquo;&nbsp; She turned to  my da.&nbsp; &lsquo;D&rsquo;you no think so, Peter?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s up to you. I never wanted tae  come in the first place.&rsquo;&nbsp; He put doon  his cards.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, better get tae bed,  then, make an early start.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked  towards the door, but Mammy put her haund on his airm.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should sleep in the  tent the night. Katie can stay in here wi Alan.&rsquo;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a guddle of putting things  away and making up beds but eventually Mammy and Daddy were in the room and  Alan in the bunk across fae me, sleeping or pretending to.&nbsp; I didnae want tae go hame the morra but I couldnae  be sad cause at last, I was sleeping all cosy in a wee bunk, just like the  Famous Five. I put my heid under the blanket, switched on the torch and began  to read.&nbsp; </p>
