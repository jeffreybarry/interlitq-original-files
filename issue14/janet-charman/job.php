              <p><strong>Telethon</strong></p>
              
            <p>and my mother out law <br>
            she&rsquo;s holding the fort<br>
            awake all night clasping her joyful bosom as the dollar total swings up and up <br>
            she won&rsquo;t tell you how much she&rsquo;s given of her pension<br>
            because it makes her feel <br>
            minute by minute<br>
            like watching among her son&rsquo;s half finished renovations <br>
            where the tiles are breaking<br>
            as the pipe&rsquo;s burst and the hot water&rsquo;s in flood<br>
            but now it hardly matters<br>
            since all of a sudden the little family have packed up and gone off to the old children&rsquo;s hospital <br>
            that they&rsquo;re fundraising to renew <br>
            with their week old baby whose blood test says she has a life threatening infection<br>
            and despite the lumbar puncture and an eleventh hour specialist assessment<br>
            the baby&rsquo;s father won&rsquo;t let them enter the room on the ward where they&rsquo;re supposed to be admitted <br>
            because it reeks to him of death <br>
            but i can&rsquo;t smell it <br>
            and when the nurse would force us from this ignorance<br>
            he shouts at her and pushes me and the little one into the corridor<br>
            that&rsquo;s our standoff right there <br>
            till her superior comes by and sniffs around <br>
            wrenches open the incubator doors <br>
            to pull out the flask of rancid formula<br>
            we gag <br>
            and then they insist we put the baby in the thing where she cries and i want her back <br>
            and lean over and stick my breast through the box top opening for her to suck<br>
            her mouth reaches up <br>
            while the nurse looks at me as if i&rsquo;m demented<br>
            some hill billy who hasn&rsquo;t even invested in a nursing bra <br>
            and is not observing the decorum of the child&rsquo;s containment <br>
            anyway she says <br>
            it&rsquo;s for her own good <br>
            she won&rsquo;t want you she has an IV drip<br>
            full stop<br>
            now settle down <br>
            we just have to wait for the test results are you both staying? we are <br>
            so they let us chuck the plastic covered mattresses on the floor <br>
            like we&rsquo;re on a noho marae but without the powhiri and the kai<br>
            and we camp out there looking up to our daughter <br>
            nearly naked above us in her heated box <br>
            but perhaps it&rsquo;s the box heat giving her that temperature he says? and turns it down<br>
            do they know best? <br>
            with the tube of dextrose and antibiotics going into her arm <br>
            my rock hard tits getting sore enough to make me septic when i whine about it <br>
            to the night nurse she gets me a hand pump <br>
            sends me to stand in the shower and draw off all that surplus milk till i&rsquo;m soft<br>
            oh yes very straight forward<br>
            but the light bulb has blown on the five metre high mausoleum ceiling<br>
            it&rsquo;s pitch black in there where the water runs cold for a first eternity over my flesh<br>
            but then <br>
            it does heat up and i get some relief <br>
            slouching back to our room to find the night nurse is leaving <br>
            the aide in charge while she and their one teenage patient zoom off to the town hall telecast <br>
            and she mentions their imminent departure to us <br>
            because we&rsquo;re the only adults within cooee <br>
            but if any of the several babies in the precinct were awake to it <br>
            they&rsquo;d want to be hurtling off to get on TV too <br>
            and so what if it is three o&rsquo;clock in the morning? <br>
            girls just want to have fun and forget they have cystic fibrosis and learn everything about the stars and the gear changes between the Princess <br>
            Mary Hospital and Queen Street where parked on a yellow line the two of them dash through the swing doors to the waiting applause of the studio audience <br>
            the phones are ringing for me and my gal bubbled up with a wild euphoria <br>
            and though the aide stays monitoring everything in the TV lounge <br>
            i don&rsquo;t want to watch any more <br>
            no i have better things to do like go and crash in the room with the sick baby and her comatose father <br>
            where it is written that men shall sleep through anything <br>
            and then i&rsquo;m wallowing with them <br>
            poolside in the lounge bar of the hotel of sweaty metal fatigue <br>
            where your stitches don&rsquo;t ache and you wake up after a minute <br>
            to the cheery voice of the AM nurse wearing shocking orange leggings with <br>
            her name in Fimo clay modelled with giraffe style letters onto her child friendly sky blue sweatshirt <br>
            and she tells us the blood tests have all come back <br>
            negative <br>
            but just in case <br>
            they&rsquo;re finishing the antibiotics <br>
            and then our alternative healthcare organics style Plunket nurse drops in <br>
            to say no matter what these orthodox practitioners think <br>
            it&rsquo;s the homeopathics she&rsquo;s been giving our baby that have done the trick <br>
            it is their feat<br>
            theirs alone<br>
            to have directed our little one home from the grey plain <br>
            and when the specialist comes along with his new house physician <br>
            we mention the distillation our darling is swallowing <br>
            and he tells the young man that &lsquo;you do get parents like this <br>
            but let them carry on with it since it&rsquo;s harmless&rsquo;<br>
            and being parents like this <br>
            we do carry on with it <br>
            although now in the light of the scientific evidence <br>
            i don&rsquo;t know what to think about anybody&rsquo;s unorthodox hopes and practices<br>
            especially since seven years after my mother out law has become vaguely aware how little time she has left for heading up hill in love and trouble <br>
            and the medical profession can&rsquo;t offer her anything <br>
            but we don&rsquo;t know about that yet<br>
            while my little girl is off and running <br>
            into her life at school while her sister has grown and been born and nearly killed me but that&rsquo;s another story <br>
            and this morning who should come walking into the class i&rsquo;m teaching at Uni <br>
            but the young woman who sped off to that Telethon with the wiry ward charge yes <br>
            here she is <br>
            with portable oxygen and a head full of ideas and blue-black hair snapping <br>
            eyes and lips hungry for everything <br>
            burning up her hopes and dreams in a fire of living <br>
            that no night <br>
            or suffering <br>
            shall screen</p>
            <BR>
