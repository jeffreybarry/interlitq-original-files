<p><strong>Bloodhound</strong><br><br>

<em>As to goodbye, not much<br>
to be said for it.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken Smith, Fox Running</em><br><br>

She follows disappointing scents<br>
from dusk to dusk,<br>
liver and tan, <br><br>

circling the city’s rim, <br>
someone driving past their own<br>
house, afraid to go in.<br><br>

She catches her death<br>
on the evening wind that scuffs<br>
the tops of trees, lifts up the bins<br><br>

and gives slow chase: death<br>
on the billboard model with her beautiful<br>
cargo of limbs,<br><br>

death in the man who rides<br>
the 26 to Hackney Wick, out<br>
from the depot, back again,<br><br>

death in the dark strip<br>
of the old canal that underlines<br>
her route downtown,<br><br>

death in the folds of city boys<br>
in tailored suits who hold<br>
their matching pints, death<br><br>

sheltering in shop doorways<br>
or walking home in shirtsleeves<br>
with his coat off,<br><br>

death asking for small change<br>
and death giving it out, pockets<br>
always deep enough.<br><br>

Death following the stockmarket.<br>
Death locking the door<br>
in its boutique hotel.<br><br>

She sniffs it out, again, again<br>
and can’t think what <br>
to do with it and carries on,<br><br>

catching an interfering scent,<br>
half-criminal, half-animal<br>
and loping down the thoroughfares,<br><br>

the Thames an interruption <br>
in the night, her trail leading across<br>
the bridge that shook and never <br><br>

fell. Nobody blocks her way.<br>
Nobody tries to leash her to their side.<br>
Nobody handles her.<br><br>

You’ve seen her with her heavy stride,<br>
her sagging chin, the dumbbells<br>
of her paws.<br><br>

She’s middle-aged, invisible.<br>
She isn’t known to raise her voice, her yap<br>
kept buried in her wrinkled chest,<br><br>

her flesh shortlived. O but they’d say<br>
her bones are artefacts, shaped<br>
over centuries, outlasting rot<br><br>

and though she is too old to bleed,<br>
her scent’s so keen she smells<br>
each drop before it forms, before<br><br>

it falls, smells it on the teenage girl<br>
who rides the Hammersmith and City,<br>
her legs crossed tight,<br><br>

smells it on the boy<br>
who walks through Shoreditch<br>
cauterised, his hand against his chest.<br><br>

She goes unnoticed, down<br>
through Crooked Usage, Long Acre,<br>
Accommodation Lane. She runs<br><br>

nose to the ground, dislodging chicken bones, <br>
the damp, unwanted pages of old news. <br>
She follows notes of piss and whisky<br><br>

till they peter out, rare places<br>
where the street’s washed clean again,<br>
gutters where the trail runs underground.<br><br>

<em>You run with the hare<br>
and you hunt with the hounds.</em><br>
That was always her trouble, always<br><br>

what troubled her, <br>
her kind set loose to bring back slaves<br>
some other century, or chase a fox<br><br>

to stillness in the woods.<br>
And part of her escaping<br>
with the uncaught prey, part of her <br><br>

loosed, part of her<br>
run to ground. <em>You hunt with the hare<br>
and you run with the hounds.</em><br><br>

She’s fickle and sincere.<br>
She has outlived her use,<br>
but sharpens at a whiff of fear,<br><br>

your dread, her dread, his dread,<br>
ours. She’s the bailiff calling<br>
out of hours, in black now, lovely,<br><br>

raising herself to her full height,<br>
listing everything you owe. You lie dead<br>
still and listen for her in the night.<br><br>

<em>Knock knock. Who’s there? <br>
It’s Nothing. Nothing who?<br>
Knock knock. It’s Nothing. You.</em><br><br><br><br></p>
