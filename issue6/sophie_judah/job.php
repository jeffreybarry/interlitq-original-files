            with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. He had been warned that she 
            would try and brainwash him about emigrating from 
            India to Israel. "She will try and force her 
            opinion down everybody's throats," his father had said, "but we know 
            what is right for us. We have attained a luxurious lifestyle here after years of hard work. Why should we give it all

            <p>"We have no time for all the ceremonies that a burial

            said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"I grew up in 
            this country and know that the Indian Army gives its officers two

            <p>"We'd never be able to sell the property if there's a grave

            <p>"Ah!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it is

            <p>"Don't be ridiculous," Ellis said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"It was daddy's wish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He didn't want to trouble us

            <p>"That's unimportant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

            you, but you didn't ask your sons before you circumcised them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was your duty as a 
            Jewish father despite the fact that the body wasn't yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now do your duty as a Jewish 
            son towards your father."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p>Charlie became angry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>"Don't teach us our duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We'll do what we want," he 
            said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p>"Yes, but I, as a self-respecting Jew, won't have a part in

            Charlie tried to read the Jewish service at a non-Jewish 
            funeral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When she came 
            home she found her sister packing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p>"Leaving?"

            <p>"I've

            and what is important."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>She turned to her sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"Believe me when I say that 
            although our children serve in the army and that there is no peace

            we are defending.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No 
            luxury can justify losing your faith or identity as a

            <p>Ronnen saw his mother nod in agreement and wondered whether she would nod and agree once again when his father accused his aunt of 'forcing her opinion down other people's throats.'</p>
