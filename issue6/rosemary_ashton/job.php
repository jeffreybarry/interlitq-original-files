            <p><span lang="EN-GB">The idea for a university in London had 
            two main motives: to bring the rapidly expanding metropolis, the 
            capital city of the most advanced country in the world, into line 
            with many European cities which already had universities; and to 
            offer a university education in England to students who were unable 
            to graduate from the two ancient universities, Oxford and Cambridge, 
            because they could not subscribe as required to the 39 Articles of 
            the Church of England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

            Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and atheists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would also expand the 
            syllabus beyond the classical, mathematical, and theological 
            subjects which dominated Oxbridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In its early years UCL, as 
            it became known after King’s College was opened in the Strand in 
            1831 as a Church-and-King rival, advertised the first chairs in the 
            country in many subjects, including English, French, German, 
            Italian, Spanish, Hebrew,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>geography, geology, botany, and physiology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            <br><br> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB">UCL’s founders were radicals and 
            liberals, many of them associated with the agitation for political 
            reform going on in Parliament and journalism in the 1820s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jeremy Bentham was an 
            influence, and the prime mover, the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell, 
            brought his experience of Scottish and German universities to the 
            table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>George Birkbeck, 
            begetter of Mechanics’ Institutes for the education of labouring 
            men, Zachary Macaulay, James Mill, and Lord John Russell were among 
            those who served on the first Council of UCL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Their 
            undisputed leader, and Chair of Council until his death in 1868, was 
            Henry Brougham, the most famous lawyer of his day and Lord 
            Chancellor in the first Whig administration after the passing of the 
            Reform Act in 1832. <br><br></span><span lang="EN-GB">Brougham and Birkbeck were also the 
            prime movers behind another reforming educational venture, begun in 
            1826 at the same time as plans were being laid for the new 
            university, namely the Society for the Diffusion of Useful 
            Knowledge, or SDUK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
            Society’s aim was to bring education to working people of little or 
            no education, by publishing cheap treatises on all sorts of 
            subjects, including up-to-date scientific topics like hydrostatics; 
            it also published a very successful <i>Penny Magazine</i> and a 
            <i>Penny Cyclopaedia</i> during its existence from 
            1826 to 1846. <br><br></span><span lang="EN-GB">The central figure in these projects, 
            Brougham, brought the highest possible profile to the new academic 
            institution because of his celebrity as one of Parliament’s best 
            orators and as a stupendously successful lawyer (he had defended 
            Queen Caroline in the famous House of Lords ‘trial’ of 1820, making 
            fools of George IV and his supporters in the process).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  <br><br> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Press attention to the new University 
            was welcome and much needed. Brougham’s influence, particularly with 
            the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, which he had helped to found in 1802, 
            and <i>The Times</i>, whose editor Thomas Barnes was a friend, 
            ensured that his doings were always in the news, often in articles 
            penned by Brougham himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>Thanks to him, the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB"> 
            </span><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">University</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, though attacked in the ultra-conservative press, was 
            given frequent favourable coverage in <i>The Times</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand, Brougham 
            acted as a magnet for negative responses too; these came from a 
            range of anti-reform commentators, including members of the Tory 
            government, the two ancient universities, and the bishops and clergy 
            of the Church of England.  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <br><br></span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Brougham was eminently caricaturable; 
            his long upturned nose was a useful feature, as was the 
            pronunciation of his name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>He often appeared in cartoons as a broom wearing a lawyer’s 
            wig and gown, or as the new broom which would ‘sweep away’ 
            injustices in the law, or as the ‘schoolmaster abroad’, carrying a 
            birchbroom for chastising pupils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘The schoolmaster is abroad’ 
            became a well-known mantra, picked up from a famous speech by 
            Brougham in the House of Commons in January 1828, in which he 
            attacked the appointment of the Duke of Wellington as Prime 
            Minister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>This 
            was not a time, he said, for the soldier to be prominent in modern 
            society; ‘there was another person abroad…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The schoolmaster was 
            abroad!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And he 
            trusted more to him, armed with his primer, than he did to the 
            soldier in full military array, for upholding and extending the 
            liberties of his country’.</font><a title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span></span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><br><br>Establishment commentators launched 
            their attacks on a kind of composite entity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It suited them to pretend

            in fact to be catered for by the SDUK) and that it would encourage 
            those classes to ferment revolution in social, political, and 
            religious matters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

            <p><span lang="EN-GB">The University opened its doors in 
            October 1828 against this background; it had no charter, little 
            money – being in essence a joint-stock company in which interested 
            patrons bought shares – and no residential arrangements for its 
            students, whom Thomas Campbell in his long letter to <i>The 
            Times</i> in February 1825 describing the plan for the new 
            institution, had envisaged as being middle-class young London men 
            living at home with their parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Professors were paid 
            according to the number of students they attracted to their courses, 
            which proved hazardous for some; they, too, had no college 
            accommodation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many were recruited as clever 
            young graduates of Oxford or Cambridge who had difficulties with the 
            Articles (men such as the brilliant young Cambridge mathematician 
            Augustus De Morgan) or teachers from the Scottish universities, 
            particularly Edinburgh, from which a number of innovative medical 
            men were appointed, only to carry on in London some of the 
            debilitating quarrels in which they had already been embroiled in 
            Edinburgh.<br><br></span><span lang="EN-GB">From the start there was disagreement on 
            the Council about whether a clergyman might become a professor; if 
            so, could that clergyman be an Anglican, or must he be a 
            dissenter?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The liberal 
            principles governing the foundation were interpreted in an illiberal 
            way by some, who objected to clergymen of any colour, and others, 
            chiefly the influential Unitarians among the shareholders, who 
            wished to make UCL a dissenting academy in all but name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>False

            University Hall be an entirely secular institution like UCL (where a 
            compromise had been reached on the question of having reverend 
            professors, but the trend was increasingly to appoint non-clergymen) 
            or should there be a chaplain, in imitation of Oxbridge, and if so, 
            of what denomination?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

            ostensible grounds that his wishes regarding the proposed

            neither an Anglican nor a dissenter of any definite kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His resignation was accepted

            in Newman’s stead to the University Hall post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The committee met in

            honest but not very satisfactory reply that he had left Oxford 
            because of doubts about his religious belief, and hardly felt in a
