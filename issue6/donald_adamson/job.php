            manhood, who nevertheless began his adult life as a radical 
            political thinker – and early exponent of Keynesianism – and who in 
            two General Elections stood as a Labour Parliamentary 
            candidate. </span></p>

            closest friends.<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Much

            year) and, soon afterwards, a Prize Fellowship of All Souls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>ALR was the first man of 
            working-class origin to win such a Fellowship, though by no means 
            the youngest man overall as Hensley Henson had been eleven months 
            younger on his election to a Prize Fellowship in 1884 and, even in 
            the year of ALR'S own election, Roger Makins was two months his 
            junior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>St Austell 
            County School and many Cornish people (ALR's family, Sir Arthur 
            Quiller Couch, the Pethericks, Miss Coode, Noreen Sweet) took pride 
            in this Fellowship; the school was given a half-day holiday on 
            receipt of the news; and George Pilcher, MP for Penryn and Falmouth, 
            wired his congratulations.</span></p>

            he did, however, move up to become Sub-Warden in 1950-1952 and

            elected an Emeritus Fellow of the College (something which was by no

            </span>Much later in his life came a further indication of a 
            prestige that was perhaps still growing, perhaps already slightly on 
            the wane, when in 1972 he was elected to membership of the Athenæum 
            Club under its prestigious Rule 2 (as W.B. Yeats had been 
            thirty-five years previously).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>I have always been fascinated by the great store he set by 
            the Benson Medal of the Royal Society of Literature, conferred upon 
            him in 1982 for meritorious works in “poetry, fiction, history, 
            biography and belles-lettres”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>He was only the twenty-eighth medallist since 1916; among its 
            previous recipients had been Gabriele d'Annunzio, Lytton Strachey, 
            E.M. Forster and Philip Larkin: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>recognition by and of “the 
            happy few”!</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">The enigma is at the level of public honours, though here 
            too there is a considerable measure of clarity if one looks deeply 
            enough and in the right places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Was ALR offered honours he 
            refused, or was he offered nothing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I occasionally asked him 
            whether he would accept a national honour if it were offered 
            him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“If it would help 
            to sell my books”, he would reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is no doubt that what 
            he most desired was the OM, that supreme accolade of personal 
            distinction which was conferred upon his All Souls colleague Sir 
            William Holdsworth in 1943, and which was also enjoyed by G.M. 
            Trevelyan, Gilbert Murray, Lord Halifax, T.S. Eliot, and that 
            “Quaker milksop” G.P. Gooch: ALR's words to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In later years it was also 
            conferred upon his former pupil C.V. Wedgwood and upon Isaiah

            to work:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>substitute one 
            historian for another; “she has my </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">OM</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">” was ALR's 
            reaction.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">An 
            immense prestige is attached to the Order of Merit, which, partly 
            because so many second-ranking politicians (or statesmen) have been 
            appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour, the latter has 
            been unable to rival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
            </span>ALR's publisher Harold Macmillan, himself an OM for the last 
            ten years of his life, was fond of recalling that three OMs (Morley, 
            Bryce, Hardy) attended his wedding in 1920.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the party held at 
            Trenarren to celebrate the award of his CH the by then very 
            debilitated stroke-victim whispered to me that he “would have 
            preferred something more academic” (by which he meant the Order of 
            Merit).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For one reason 
            or another there was no chance that he would be offered it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Was he ever offered a 
            knighthood, as William Waldegrave has suggested?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Certainly, much was done to 
            block “[his] </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">OM</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">” by the so-called 
            Maecenas Committee on which both Isaiah Berlin and C.V. Wedgwood 
            sat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a big job 
            even to get ALR the CH, something to which, in 1993 and again in 
            1996, I myself devoted a good deal of time and effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>From March 1989 to 
            June 1990 Woodrow Wyatt had tried in vain with Margaret Thatcher to 
            obtain an honour for him, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">he</i> was merely thinking of a 
            knighthood.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">Honour is not always the polar opposite of dishonour, 
            often being the antithesis of obscurity or oblivion or disrepute; it 
            is not even synonymous with reputation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The “most unkindest cut of 
            all”, two years after ALR's death, has been the memoir of him by his 
            All Souls colleague John McManners, who, clergyman as he was and no 
            doubt plain-speaking friend, conducted with becoming decorum his 
            memorial service in All Souls College Chapel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, according to this 
            memoir, ALR was “an impossible figure” “tarnished” by “lunatic 
            self-importance”, “overweening self-esteem”,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“selfishness”, “spleen”, 
            “ranting”, “rumbustious vulgarity”, and a man who in one of his 
            books “blatantly plagiarizes”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>It is this insinuation of plagiarism, based on a joke about 
            All Souls, that most rankles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>Incidentally, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">rumbustiousness</i> is no 
            dishonour, nor is it a personal failing.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">Extreme epithets such as those of John McManners do 
            perhaps detract from ALR's reputation; they do nothing to impugn his 
            honour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He fortunately 
            cared little for his personal reputation despite having a fatherly 
            but also businesslike concern for the reputation of books that were 
            personally and distinctively his.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">What remains to be established is his reputation as one

            Cottage was, and is, an ancient fisherman’s cottage in the very 
            heart of the village, three storeys high, the ground floor being 
            what is known in those parts as a “cellar”, where in the old days 
            the fisherman would store pilchards and conger eels in brine in 
            readiness for the winter months, and where also he would keep and 
            mend his nets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
            </span>More recently this cellar had been used as a shop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I decided to make it into a 
            second-hand and antiquarian bookshop and ran it successfully for six 
            years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>In 
            February 1984 I wrote to Rowse suggesting that I should stock his 
            books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>His 
            response, needless to say, was delighted: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“come and see me on 25 
            February”.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">This, unbeknown to me at the time, illustrated the 
            extraordinary openness with which he reacted to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">some</i> interventions from the

            </span>solipsistic though he said he was, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in</i> but not really <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">of</i> St Austell, alienated 
            from his family (at least two branches of which lived within a few 
            miles of his home), and stubbornly unwilling to receive many 
            visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In short: he 
            reacted favourably to me because I was keen to sell his

            <p><span lang="EN-GB">It

            society during the later 1950s (had he done so, I would certainly 
            have attended it).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>This, of course, was the time when Rowse was beginning to

            believe it is a fact that he gave no talks or lectures to University 
            clubs and societies during the time when I was an undergraduate (in 
            my time at Oxford he did, however, speak to a handful of college 
            societies, such as at New College on “The Edwardian Churchills” and 
            at Trinity on “The Cecils”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>My experience differed, therefore, from William Golding’s, 
            who told me that he attended a talk given by Rowse while he 
            (Golding) was an undergraduate; this was probably his address to the 
            Brasenose Club, on “War and Psychology”, delivered on 16 May

            know this at the time, was on one of his regular holidays at 
            Trenarren; he was in the habit of paying a visit there most 
            summers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I, who was at 
            Lanhydrock with my wife and two small sons, recognized him first in

            break in on his conversation with Simmons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I remember ALR to this day, 
            just standing there in the shop, holding forth in his inimitable

            </span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The lunch, cooked by the faithful 
            and longsuffering Phyllis Cundy, was an excellent Cornish pasty, 
            with a trifle to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>We sat in his spacious library throughout the afternoon as 
            the mists gathered from the sea and clambered up his garden 
            slopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We discussed my 
            writing, which he hoped I would persevere with: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>there were, he thought, “at 
            least a dozen books inside [me] still waiting to be written”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I noted afterwards in my 
            diary that I was now looking out for two further books for him: 
            <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Trollope’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Three Clerks</i> and a study of 
            the freethinker Matthew Tindal who he believed may well have been a 
            Fellow of All Souls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>[Tindal was.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He 
            remarked that most of his library was in 
            </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, just as most of his 
            money was in dollars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>Urging me always to keep in touch with David Treffry, and to 
            remain friends, he said he would also like me also to encourage and 
            up to a point assist him in the writing of one or two books, once he 
            (David) had retired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Three months later he hosted a 
            dinner party at the Athenæum in celebration of his eighty-second 
            birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He looked 
            amazingly strong and fit, telling me that his present vigour was all 
            due to working so hard in the garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among his guests were 
            Anthony Curtis, literary editor of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Financial Times</i>, Charles 
            Moore, at that time editor of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Spectator</i>, and the 
            biographer Rosalie Glynn Grylls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">Thus my meetings with Rowse accumulated and I find it 
            amazing how varied were the places at which we met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">The next occasion was on the home ground of the Royal 
            Society of Literature’s then premises in Hyde Park Gardens, where he 
            treated Fellows to a Christmas poetry-reading of the works of West 
            Country poets, Hardy, Hawker, Betjeman, Charles Causley, Rosalie 
            Glynn Grylls – and, naturally, himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He introduced me to many as 
            “Lord Polperro” (his friendly nickname for me, just as he referred 
            to “John Trebetjeman” and “David Treefrog”:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I will not enumerate them 
            all).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Puzzled by this, 
            the author Bryan Guinness, also known as Lord Moyne, said to 
            me:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You’re not really 
            Lord Polperro, are you?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>Afterwards I drove Rowse back to the </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Athenæum</span><span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I shan’t 
            attend Frank Longford’s birthday party tonight”, he announced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>“Unlike Rosalie 
            Mander, I’m simply not interested”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">Then, in January 1986, I lunched with him at Trenarren 
            where he had </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">“killed the fatted chicken in my 
            honour”;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I brought with 
            me the shell church (it was of St Mary’s, Penzance) which John 
            Betjeman had bequeathed to him and which I had collected from the 
            poet’s home in Radnor Walk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>And again in June of that year I lunched with him at 
            Trenarren, when the other guests were William and Ann Golding, A.N. 
            Wilson and Diana Colville.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">In the following month I stayed 
            with him at All Souls.</span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">My first sight of him, on my 
            arrival at the college, was of the great self-publicist conducting a 
            group of American tourists – English-Speaking Union, I think – 
            around the Great Quadrangle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>He waved cheerily and shouted across the lawn:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I’ll see you in an hour or 
            so”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was put into 
            T.E. Lawrence’s bedroom looking on to 
            </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Catte 
            Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"> and St Mary’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rowse was “camping out” in 
            rooms in the south-east corner of Great Quad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was full of conversation 
            about his book on Quiller Couch, parts of which he was going to have 
            to rewrite because of new material which had come his way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Francis Warner joined us for 
            drinks in a charming garden, bringing a pile of books intended for 
            Rowse; but some of these Rowse already had, so he gave those to 
            me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>    
                 At dinner I sat next to the Acting 
            Warden, Peter Fraser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>He displayed a strong dislike of Rowse, considering that, 
            from the standpoint of other writers, he had ruined virtually every 
            subject he had ever touched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>After dessert Charles Monteith, Rowse and I took our coffee 
            outside beneath the twin towers and in full view of the mellow 
            outline of the Radcliffe Camera; we were joined by John Sparrow, 
            who, broken in health though he was, worked himself up into a lather 
            of indignation at one of Rowse’s chance remarks.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">And so the pattern of our meetings continued, with 
            seemingly endless permutations and even some surprises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In August 1986 my wife Helen 
            met him for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>He had been unwell since the previous day, suffering from his 
            all too recurrent digestive troubles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I sat with him in his 
            bedroom but, at the mention of Helen (who had gone down for a stroll 
            on the beach), he insisted on meeting her, got out of bed, put on a 
            dressing-down, came downstairs – and she and I drank sherry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He showed me the second part 
            of the MS of his book on Quiller Couch, to which he had added very 
            considerably in view of the new material supplied by the novelist’s 
            great-nephew Guy </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Simondson:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it was the </span><span lang="EN-GB">material on which he had been working at All Souls in the 
            previous month.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In 
            September 1986 he lectured in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Truro</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> on 
            the controversial South African cleric Bishop John William Colenso 
            and at tea with him early in November of that year he gave me his 
            copy of André Billy’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Vie de 
            Balzac</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Three years 
            on I attended a second lecture, this time at Camborne, on Bishop 
            Colenso, about whom – and the latter’s cousin – he was publishing a 
            book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a 
            brilliant performance, full of his familiar <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">boutades</i>, and firing many 
            broadsides against the academic establishment and the “third-rate 
            professors”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Against 
            the Church too, in that it had refused to accept the findings of the 
            higher biblical criticism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br>Although I was to meet ALR 
            seventy or so times after that, perhaps I may be forgiven for not 
            recording all those occasions but also for recording a few 
            more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">It 
            was problematic gaining admission to the Trenarren fortress, where 
            Rowse and his aged but very sprightly housekeeper Phyllis Cundy 
            would retire to their respective bedrooms about 
            </span><st1:metricconverter productid="4.30 in"><span lang="EN-GB">4.30 in</span></st1:metricconverter><span lang="EN-GB"> the 
            afternoon and where, in order to save opening the front door, 
            groceries were sometimes hauled up in a basket to the first floor 
            and payment was dangled down to the recipient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I would arrive at the house 
            almost always unannounced and was indeed fortunate to be able to 
            turn up in that way, for, whenever she was at home and could hear 
            the knock on the front door, I was always welcomed in by 
            Phyllis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If she did not 
            open the door, I would go on to the terrace and throw gravel up to 
            Rowse’s bedroom window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>He would almost invariably hear this, appear at the window, 
            see me, and come down to open the door himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">On 
            one occasion, however, there was no sight or sound either of himself 
            or of Phyllis; and, as it was before the days of mobile telephones, 
            I drove the couple of miles to Pentewan, the next village, and rang 
            the sacrosanct ex-directory number from a telephone box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I well remember this 
            episode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was raining 
            and thundering outside the box, a woman was waiting her turn to make 
            a telephone call, whilst I painfully endeavoured to speak to 
            Rowse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>I was 
            reluctant to go all the way back to Polperro without seeing him and 
            may well have had some books for him. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>From his bedroom he picked up 
            the receiver but could hear little or nothing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I resorted in the end to 
            thundering that it was “Lord Polperro” on the line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No sooner had I pronounced 
            these words than he could hear immediately – but thought I had said 
            “John Sparrow”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I could 
            hardly put the receiver down by this point but stumbled through a 
            hasty and embarrassing telephone call, reassuring him, in response 
            to his enquiries, that “I” was really quite flourishing in my Iffley 
            retreat and looked forward to seeing him again whenever he might be 
            in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Oxford</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">What the woman standing outside the telephone box must 
            have thought of this performance I simply cannot imagine.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">Having established that ALR was at home, I drove the two 
            miles back to Trenarren, where he now welcomed me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We talked for an hour or so 
            but, to the best of my recollection, neither of us mentioned John 
            Sparrow.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">On 
            another visit to Trenarren, some years later, it was again 
            impossible to stir him or Phyllis into action; so, having by now 
            acquired a mobile telephone, I rang him on that. He, awakened to the 
            external world, came downstairs, let me in and asked:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“How did you 
            telephone?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“From my 
            car”, I replied:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to 
            which, as he seemed to be looking in vain for a telephone box, his 
            only reaction was, “How extraordinary!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was far removed in spirit 
            from the modern technological age, not even using a typewriter but 
            writing all his books in neat, tidy and meticulous longhand until 
            the very end of his life, from which script they were typed up by a 
            succession of typists over the years (among these, latterly, being 
            the Oxford graduate Robin Davidson and the mother of the historian 
            John Vincent).</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">Then there was the occasion when I – or was it he? – 
            managed to get ourselves locked out of his house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was an episode I never 
            cared to see repeated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>I had come to the house on a day almost as warm as any in 
            mid-summer (the date was </span><st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="4"><span lang="EN-GB">20 April 1987</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-GB">), bringing him books he had asked me to obtain for 
            him:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>this was a far 
            harder task for a bookseller before the advent of the internet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was not, or did not 
            appear to be, at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>I therefore tried his garage door, found it unlocked, and 
            placed the books on the bootlid of his red Morris Marina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After which I drove on a few 
            miles and spent a happy afternoon on the beach and in the sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On my way home to Polperro I 
            could not resist calling at Trenarren again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This time there was a 
            response to my knock at the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I went upstairs and sat with 
            him in his bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>“I’ve brought you your books”, I said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“They’re in the garage on 
            the boot of your car”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>“Impossible!” he snapped; whereupon he jumped out of bed, 
            donned his dressing-gown and, followed by me, stalked straight 
            downstairs, out to the garage – and found the books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You were right!” he 
            admitted, with commendable honesty but nevertheless with the 
            greatest reluctance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He 
            then realized that, instead of previously locking the door of his 
            garage, he had now inadvertently locked the front door of his 
            house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was duly 
            anathematized even though I was offering to climb up to a 
            first-floor window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>Upon closer examination of his dressing-gown pocket he, 
            luckily for us both, discovered a key to the glass door of the 
            porch; and peace was restored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
            </span>But I shall never forget those three words “You were right!” 
            which he could never bring himself to say in the all too numerous 
            confrontations of life – as, most notably, in the Appeasement crisis 
            – where the issue was not one of black versus white but of opposing 
            shades of grey.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB">These were the only two disagreements we ever had:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>one on the easily 
            verifiable, then incontrovertible, matter of whether the books had 
            been left in the garage; the other on the major geopolitical matter 
            of Appeasement and the Munich Agreement, where the opposing sides of 
            the debate are finely balanced and argument will never cease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On one occasion I could not 
            resist bringing up the name of Neville Chamberlain as Rowse lay in 
            bed bemoaning all the damage done by the Second World War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tears came to his eyes as he 
            mentioned some of the young undergraduates he had taught and who had 
            subsequently laid down their lives in battle. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He wept as he spoke of some

            turned away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One day 
            Rowse and I were conversing in his bedroom, Phyllis, deaf at the 
            best of times, was perhaps resting, when all of a sudden there was a 
            ringing of the doorbell, repeated and insistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There’s someone at the 
            door”, I said – for Rowse too was, perhaps rather selectively, 
            deaf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>“Ignore 
            it!” he commanded, but still the ringing continued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I went downstairs and, 
            through the glass door of the porch, saw a youngish couple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>“I’ve just come hoping
