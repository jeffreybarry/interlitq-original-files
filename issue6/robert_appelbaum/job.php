            </span>What’s all the fuss about?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was my question. To 
            listen to Londoners, in the past twenty years the city had become a 
            world capital of cuisine, its best restaurants on par with the best 
            anywhere, its ethnic restaurants the envy of Europe. Encouraged by 
            the flourishing of farmer’s markets, a new ethic of organic and 
            locally sourced produce and animal products, and an infrastructure 
            of food obsession, featured daily on television, the print media, 
            and the Internet, its food culture was said to be vibrant, 
            innovative, even world-shaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The <i>Guide Michelin</i> 
            for restaurants has for the first time devoted a whole volume to it, 
            making it only the fourth city to be so documented, after Paris, New 
            York, and San Francisco, and causing not a few outbursts of superbia 
            among the locals.<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name=_ftnref1><sup>1</sup></A> Indeed, I have heard 
            well travelled Londoners say they prefer their home town to Paris, 
            which is too much of a museum to their taste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are no new ideas in 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Paris</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">, the 
            feeling goes, nothing but the tried and true – steak frites and 
            moules frites and, if you’re lucky, a very old cassoulet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">, by 
            contrast, just about anywhere you go you are going to be served the 
            next new thing – and very likely by a Frenchman, who has fled his 
            homeland for more fertile kitchens.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>I was sceptical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>I had had some excellent meals in 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">, 
            but I had had some mediocre and downright awful meals there as 
            well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I always had a 
            good time visiting the metropolis, and being food obsessed myself, I 
            could think of no better way to <i>ouvrir l’appétit</i> on a cool 
            dark evening than to wander the back streets of the West End, the 
            restaurant capital of the capital, in search of the perfect menu and 
            the empty table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I 
            didn’t believe the hype.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>I was suspicious of the chauvinism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And in any case, being 
            something of a social scientist, I needed to see for 
            myself.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>        Being something 
            of a social scientist, too, I needed to engage in seeing for 
            myself from an uncommon perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I needed to check out the 
            scene not as a naive consumer, or a food critic giving advice to 
            consumers, but as an informed participant observer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I needed to do a field study 
            in other words, and observe, with a plausible degree of 
            systematicity and critical self-consciousness, as both an insider 
            and an outsider, the customs of the natives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fuss about 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> 
            food, for or against, accurate or phony, is itself an aspect of a 
            larger phenomenon: the buying and selling, the providing, the 
            eating, the digesting, the reporting, the assessing, and the 
            circulation of information about food in 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These 
            things are all parts of a single cultural field, and it is to the 
            cultural field that the social scientist will likely turn his or her 
            attention. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>How, really, 
            is food culturally organized in and about 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How was it 
            organized, that is – for this, in my view, is what ‘the cultural’ 
            adds up to – phenomenologically, which is also to say, given the 
            constitution of the phenomenal, symbolically, structurally, 
            materially, and economically?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>That is the main question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And at bottom it involves 
            coming to terms with the <i>situation</i> of food in that postmodern 
            world of which </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> is 
            one of the main social and economic centres.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where and how is food 
            <i>located</i> in a city like </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What 
            material and symbolic values are assigned to it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How are these values 
            asserted, negotiated, and experienced?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>  And what then is all 
            the fuss about?</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>So there are the research questions, large and small.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, I only had 
            five days in which to perform an initial study of the subject, and, 
            being a social scientist, I didn’t have a lot of money to do it with 
            either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But that 
            could prove to be a boon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Under the conditions of scarcity imposed on me by my budget, 
            I could observe myself observing the cuisine of the city in 
            circumstances as most food critics, travel writers, and especially 
            consumers really do experience it – hit or miss, with limited time 
            and resources at their disposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could study it from a 
            vantage point of what Bernard Lahire (2003) calls the ‘sociology of 
            the individual’, or what followers of Michel de Certeau (1998) call 
            the ‘sociology of doing’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>At least playfully, in the spirit of the Menippean Satire as 
            well as in the framework of modern sociology and cultural studies, I 
            could look at the world of food consumption from an emphatically 
            limited, contingent, under-resourced vantage point, and therefore 
            see it as only an individual can see it – for that is what 
            individuals are, limited, contingent and under-resourced, required 
            to pursue individual ends within the terms of a system that is not 
            of their own making.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>Whether I could observe without evaluating was another 
            question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>   
                It is one thing to observe the 
            customs of the natives, however self-aware one is about the 
            limitations of observation: it was another to eat their food; and it was 
            still another to eat their food with or without registering value 
            judgements about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 
            the end, I found that value judgements were inescapable, in large 
            part because no one like me can sample a cuisine, whatever the 
            guidelines of a ‘science’, without also assessing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To taste is also to exercise 
            taste, to make discriminations among sensations and processes with a 
            view toward pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>There can be no fully neutral science of food.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>I have seen plenty of studies from social scientists that 
            seem to presume otherwise, to be sure, imagining to extricate 
            themselves and their readers from the subjectivity they are 
            studying, and to assert a disinterested sociology of the group, but 
            the results are unconvincing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>That may be said even about Pierre Bourdieu and his 
            <i>Distinction </i>(1984), a work that is commonly cited as if it 
            were the final word on the matter, held up as definitive proof that 
            the subjective experience of taste is really an objectively 
            determined performance of class – and this in spite of several 
            inconvenient facts that undermine that assessment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, at the time 
            of its publication in English, Bourdieu’s study was already dated, 
            describing a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">France</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><span lang="EN-GB"> of the past, and especially a working class culture, 
            like similar cultures in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><span lang="EN-GB"> and the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">United 
            States</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><span lang="EN-GB">, 
            that was in its death throes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>For another, for all its surveys and tables of results, it 
            actually took the form of a polemic against Kantian aesthetics and 
            the snobbery of post-war Parisian intellectuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And for a third, Bourdieu 
            was not actually a cultural relativist and was not arguing that 
            taste was merely determined by class, but arguing instead that taste 
            was a domain of the social struggle for dominance (see Bennett 
            2005).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bourdieu was 
            writing with an agenda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>And if the disinterestedness of the sociology of the group is 
            a bit of a phantom in the work of Bourdieu, it is even more so in a 
            recent, British sociology of food that claims that people like me, 
            with cosmopolitan eating habits and interests and lusts, are 
            ‘cultural omnivores’ (Warde 2000: note the use of this loaded term 
            ‘omnivore’ as if it were merely a dispassionately descriptive term) 
            or even worse, that such cultural omnivores are ‘predatory,’ their 
            practices involving a ‘pillage of resources’, a ‘scouring of 
            habitats’, an ‘uprooting and repackaging of the foreign, the novel, 
            the dangerous’ (Bell 2002).<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name=_ftnref2><sup>2</sup></A><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mainstream food 
            sociology in Britain is no less located in its assessments of the 
            food practices of modern Brits than the Brits themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is surprisingly 
            biased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>So: both the practice of eating and the study of it are 
            located in all kinds of ways; they always have an agenda, and always 
            must.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In my study, in 
            any case, the legitimacy of which can only be assessed by its 
            results, the subject and the sociologist would be one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The individual and the 
            sociologisation of the individual through systematic observation 
            would be one. Or rather two, since the research would be a team 
            effort, involving an invaluable research associate (Marion Scott 
            Appelbaum), as well as the team leader (me).</span></p>

            </span>Together we laid our plans carefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would stay in a budget 
            hotel in a residential area, a little off the beaten track but 
            convenient enough to the restaurants and shops we wanted to 
            visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To save money, 
            we would do most of our major dining at lunch time, and take 
            advantage of lunch-time specials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would visit as many 
            different kinds of places as time allowed, although we were 
            especially interested in the new things and the most popular things 
            among knowing Londoners – for example, that hybrid form of social 
            life known as ‘modern British cuisine’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would also visit shops 
            and markets, and study street life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What, again, was the 
            phenomenological, material and symbolic place of food, the situation 
            of food in modern </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We took 
            along notebooks, a laptop, and a Dictaphone, along with a <i>Time 
            Out Guide to Dining in London</i>, 2007 edition (the <i>Michelin 
            </i>is much less thorough), and observations culled from various 
            Internet sites, including the on-line Zagat survey and the annual 
            World’s Fifty Best Restaurants featured on the site of the 
            London-based <i>Restaurant</i> magazine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing how limited our 
            resources were, we knew not only that our findings would be partial, 
            tentative, and somewhat arbitrary, but that our project was 
            following less in the footsteps of Boas, Malinowski, and 
            Lévi-Strauss than in those of the countless journalists for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">New York Times</i> going on city 
            breaks and reporting back to well-heeled readers about where to 
            stay, what to see, and where to dine in Prague, or Singapore, or 
            Kansas City.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only we 
            would not pretend to observe the object of a 36-hour city with 
            timely objectivity, dispensing advice to consumers.</span></p>

            </span>Even if I am only something of a social scientist, I am 
            officially very much a professional literary critic, and so the fact 
            that I was following in the footsteps of journalists provided an 
            additional incentive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>My trip to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> 
            would not only provide a window on the sociology of the individual, 
            but give me a chance to look behind the scenes of what amounts to a 
            literary genre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Thirty-six Hours in Akron, What’s Doing in Berlin: fun to 
            read, providing you with tips for a future visit if ever you’re 
            lucky enough to go on one, and in any case furnishing you with the 
            vicarious pleasure of pretending to go on a whirlwind trip to some 
            far-off burg, these exercises in travel journalism have a form of 
            their own, a rhetoric of their own, an illusory objectivity all 
            their own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, 
            after a while, a modern literary critic may well come to find that 
            there is something fictional about them, or even factitious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are not only formulaic; 
            they almost always describe an experience that is <i>too good to be 
            true</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to 
            see what lay behind the exercises, and think about how language and 
            convention mediates between the experience of the writer and the 
            material that is actually written.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, again, we had two kinds 
            of questions to answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>What would our five days in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> 
            tell us about the culture of eating in 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">, 
            and what would it tell us about the culture of writing about 
            food?</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p></O:P></span></p>

            </span>We were out on the streets within moments of checking into 
            our hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were in 
            Kensington, not a ‘typical’ </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> 
            neighbourhood one might say, but what is ‘typical’, and why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kensington is very wealthy 
            and residential; it has its own ‘high street’ with small and large 
            shops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not a 
            major destination for either locals or tourists, although there are 
            a number of hotels (we got an excellent deal, in a comfortably 
            shabby establishment, it being off-season) and there were plenty of 
            tourists on the streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>It is not a place where one goes out of one’s way to dine, 
            but it is not an area where one cannot dine either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of my research 
            there, an old department store was being converted into a very large 
            new Whole Foods market, the first outpost in 
            </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><span lang="EN-GB"> of the American organic-gourmet food chain, and, it has 
            been said in the press, sure to change food retailing in 
            </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><span lang="EN-GB"> utterly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Perhaps we were researching a ‘before’, with an ‘after’ to 
            come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In any case, the 
            sociological model of that which is statistically ‘typical’ in the 
            context of a vast, diverse, cosmopolitan, and always rapidly 
            changing metropolis is almost certainly irrelevant. What is typical 
            about </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> is 
            its variety. Or not quite: for even if 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> has 
            lots of variety in its social and cultural life, it has variety in 
            its own way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has its 
            own way, one might say, of <i>distributing variety</i>, and what one 
            encounters when one visits the city, is not only what is unique 
            about unique places, institutions, and people, but perhaps even more 
            importantly, and certainly more noticeably, are its systems of what 
            may be called <i>continuity-in-variety</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These are systems inscribed 
            in its architecture, its structures of transportation and 
            communication, its patterns of work and leisure, of production, 
            distribution, and consumption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>The guidebooks direct the tourist to ‘landmarks’ like the 
            Nelson column in Trafalgar Square; the restaurant guides direct the 
            gourmand-tourist to places like Sketch, ‘the most expensive 
            restaurant in London,’ as almost all references to the establishment 
            are quick to mention (Cooke, 2003).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will have more to say 
            about the idea of the unique in what follows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say for now, 
            that though the unique is everywhere promoted, it is the 
            ‘everywhere’ itself that really presses upon experience, and 
            continuity-in-variety is what the social scientist is obliged to 
            observe and explain. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>Out on the streets, in Kensington, as social scientists more 
            or less following the route of a tourist-<i>flaneu</i>r-gourmand, 
            passing along a route from Kensington Road to Kensington High 
            Street, sensing the continuities of London life – the architecture, 
            the pace of the traffic, the smell of the air – we looked for 
            food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And at first we 
            didn’t see much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>London 
            has historically been a city of eating behind closed doors, and as 
            for food shops, whatever the situation may have been in the past, by 
            now they have almost entirely been absorbed by a handful of big 
            ‘multiples’, the large corporations like Tesco and Sainsbury’s, 
            which have placed almost all the food available for consumption 
            inside big boxes with little outdoor display.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the first thing to 
            know about the continuity-in-variety of the culture of food in 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is 
            almost entirely hidden from view. You do not encounter vegetable 
            stands on the streets of London, or food stalls, or the smells of 
            cooking, or the sight of people dining (except sometimes through 
            plate-glass windows, especially the floor–to–ceiling windows common 
            to coffee and sandwich shops), though you may well encounter that in 
            many sections of many other large cities in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can go for miles on the 
            streets of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">, in 
            other words, without encountering a tomato.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(The few vaunted outdoor food 
            markets are in fact quite tucked away, the most famous of them, the 
            Borough Market, being hidden under a viaduct in a nondescript 
            neighbourhood.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What 
            you encounter everywhere are establishments through the doors of 
            which or behind the plate glass windows of which food is to be 
            found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>   And 
            not just any establishments: as a corollary to the fact that 
            food is behind closed doors and windows, the second thing to know 
            is that the London food scene is almost entirely dominated by large 
            corporations, with multiple locations – signages, brands, doorways 
            to enter, open doorways sometimes, but doorways all the same, or 
            else glassed-in eating areas that, instead of being terraces open to 
            the city, as in (say) Paris and Rome, are almost always, rather, 
            very much <i>glassed-in</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>The largest of corporations have dotted the terrain with 
            McDonald’s and Pizza Huts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>And smaller, local corporations, specializing in all sorts of 
            food, from Japanese to Portuguese to a hybrid called ‘world food’, 
            have bred multiples too: Wagamama (23 locations as of March 2007), 
            Pizza Express (96), Ask (23), Balls Brothers (18), Zizi (16), Yo! 
            Sushi (18), Nando’s (54: a Portuguese chicken shop), Giraffe (11: an 
            establishment where you are promised ‘world food’ but where the main 
            attraction appears to be the English breakfast).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even restaurants that aspire 
            to fine dining can come in multiples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are eight branches of 
            Chez Gerard, five of Bertorelli’s, ten of Fish Works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the most renowned and 
            most expensive restaurants in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB">, 
            Gordon Ramsay, has developed into a multiple of ten locations in 
            </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> – 
            each with its own culinary identity, its own menu, head chef, and 
            style, to be sure, but each belonging to a corporate multiple all 
            the same. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>But I hadn’t taken stock of all that yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My knowledge was in 
            brackets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was 
            attempting to experience the phenomenology of food afresh. 
            </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>So we were out on the streets, on a bright but chilly early 
            spring day, looking for a culture of food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We passed a number of 
            imposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century buildings, what the 
            English sometimes call ‘mansions’ though they are actually blocks of 
            flats and townhouses, and the imposing facade of a genuinely unique 
            institution, The Milestone Hotel, with a restaurant inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The hotel is ‘five 
            star’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every reference 
            you find to it in guidebooks or on the web makes that assertion, and 
            comments from customers on web-sites like Trip Adviser consistently 
            confirm that the hotel is ‘perfect’ or nearly so, that it is a ‘true 
            five star’, and so forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Certainly, the hotel, composed out of a pair of Victorian 
            ‘mansions’, was handsome; at first, I thought it was a private club, 
            and I imagined it as a place where the Prince of Wales would feel at 
            home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(And after all, 
            it is just off </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Prince of Wales 
            Street</span></ST1:ADDRESS></ST1:STREET><span lang="EN-GB">.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it is just a hotel, 
            albeit an idiosyncratic and expensive one, with rooms starting at 
            about £250.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And anyway, 
            we were interested in food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>A very handsome looking plaque indicated a restaurant inside, 
            and displayed a menu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Called Cheneston, it had items like a starter of ‘Terrine of 
            foie gras with toasted brioche and pear chutney’ for £17.00 and a 
            main course of ‘Pot roast supreme of guinea fowl with celeriac and 
            parsley mash, morel mushroom sauce’ for £24.50; ‘Tournedos of 
            Aberdeen Angus beef, galette potato and burgundy shallot sauce’ for 
            £29.50; and for the vegetarian, a ‘Pea and mint risotto with seared 
            scallops and minted foam’ for £29.50.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Expensive, in other words (American readers, 
            we are talking fifty to sixty dollars for a main course in 
            2007 dollars), and devoted to a conventional if a little updated 
            British-Continental style of eating, the restaurant already stood 
            for me as a representative of the hazards of triumphant London 
            cuisine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Heavy and rich 
            food this was; if not unappetizing (some of the dishes seem very 
            promising) it was nevertheless bulky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Above all, it was mish-mash 
            food, French ingredients, cooking techniques, and terms 
            (<i>galette</i>, <i>tournedos</i>), combined with a few Italian and 
            Spanish tricks (the risotto, the ‘foam’), vying against Asian 
            condiments (chutney, but made from an English fruit), British 
            ingredients (</span><st1:city><st1:place><i><span lang="EN-GB">Aberdeen</span></i></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span lang="EN-GB"> beef), and un-ironic allusions to bland English home 
            cooking (pot roast and mash, rather than <i>daube</i> and 
            <i>purée</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Triumphant London cuisine going back to the days of Carême 
            and the heyday of the Empire has ever been thus, featuring a 
            vocabulary that is hybrid, and a style of eating that is heavy 
            rather than light, organised around the consumption of meats with 
            sauces, starches, and condiments (see Goody, 1982; Mennell, 1985; 
            Colquhoun, 2007).</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>We went on, down </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Kensington Road</span></ST1:ADDRESS></ST1:STREET><span lang="EN-GB">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Indian 
            restaurant nearby boasted a ‘fusion’ cuisine, which on the evidence 
            of the menu mainly meant curried meats – roasted beef, braised lamb, 
            and stir-fried chicken portions, served in sauces made with raisins, 
            garum marsala, and chili.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>We next saw a convenience shop, a narrow and shallow emporium 
            where one could buy cigarettes, liquor, newspapers, and urgent 
            foodstuffs, like fruit juice, soft drinks, canned beans, and 
            eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I went in to buy 
            a newspaper, and stood in line at the high checkout counter behind 
            an American woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She 
            was nervously studying the display of confections below the cash 
            register – Cadbury’s milk bars, Mars Bars, KitKats, those sorts of 
            things, at least fifty different kinds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked and looked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A heavy set woman in her 
            forties, she was perturbed, while both I behind her and the clerk in 
            front of her huffed and puffed, waiting for her to make a 
            decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, she 
            blurted it out, expressed her desire and befuddlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Don’t you have any English 
            toffee?’ she asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
            clerk, a young man, an immigrant from the east, paused before 
            answering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like most 
            Englishmen, I am sure he had never heard of ‘English toffee’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Only have what’s here’, he 
            said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman 
            tottered away, indignant, and I bought my paper.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>Out on the streets, as we reached the corner of Kensington 
            Road and Kensington High Street, we finally found a row of colourful 
            establishments, One Restaurant, an Iranian establishment, a Prezzo, 
            a Strada, a Café Uno (three similar Italian chain restaurants, 
            specializing in pizza and pasta), a Starbucks, a Giraffe, Utsav, an 
            Indian takeout, Stick and Bowl, a Chinese noodle house, another 
            convenience market, and then further along, off Kensington High 
            Street, two places in an alley that were the first restaurants that 
            attracted this particular ‘cultural omnivore,’ arousing his culinary 
            curiosity, Cuba and Arcadia, the latter a genuinely local, which is 
            to say individually owned and operated Italian restaurant, the 
            former a Cuban theme establishment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scene for someone like 
            me – a ‘predatory’ food enthusiast with a taste for picturesque and 
            adventurous eating – was starting to seem hopeful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then as I turned back up 
            to Kensington High Street I found that this small strip of 
            restaurants was pretty much the end of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of the rest of 
            Kensington High Street, and the side streets immediately off it, was 
            devoid of culinary culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </span>Big clothing stores predominated, the kind one would find on 
            almost any high street in all of 
            </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><span lang="EN-GB">: an Accessorize, a Top Shop, a Gap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, if you were 
            blindfolded and driven about for a bit, and let down in the middle 
            of Kensington High Street, apart from the Tube station, it would be

            Chinese women had ordered à la carte.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>The food came on what looked like 
            better dishes. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp;</SPAN>A handsome pork dish, with the pork 
            slices fanned over a dark and steaming sauce came first, followed by 
            a plate of dark green Chinese broccoli, sprinkled with what looked 
            like flecks of garlic and ginger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>In fact, the women called the 
            waiter over, and got into a heated discussion with him about the 
            broccoli.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>Look at this, they were apparently saying, it’s too ... soggy 
            probably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>Eventually, after extensive negotiation, the waiter picked up 
            the plate and took it back to the kitchen.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>About 
            five minutes later he returned with another dish of broccoli, which 
            this time indeed looked a bit brighter and crisper.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He also 
            brought the women a plate of fish slices, lightly sauteed and served 
            with a pale, translucent sauce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>The women dug in: the pork, the 
            fish, the greens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Meanwhile I was getting a 
            bellyache, forcing myself to consume our glop, trying to put on a 
            good show for my assistant, who had only picked at her food, and was 
            finding solace in the crisp white wine we had ordered.</SPAN></P>

            </SPAN>We had other meals planned: a posh Sardinian meal; a trendy

            Spitalfields; dinner at a Wagamama, one of the semi-fast-food

            >&nbsp; </SPAN>The best of the meals was enjoyed 
            at the eco-friendly restaurant, a place called Acorn House, in 
            King’s Cross.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>At Sardo, on Grafton Way in 
            Fitzrovia, we ate a meal that, however close to a Sardinian 
            experience it really was (probably not that close, though the basic 
            ingredients of the dishes and the approach to cooking seemed 
            authentic enough), would have fit right in to the fashionably funky 
            Italian dining scene in New York or Chicago (in fact, I have since 
            eaten in a place in upper Manhattan just like, except that the 
            patrons had darker hair and higher cheekbones).<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Along 
            with a guest we had (collectively) spaghetti bottarga, made with 
            mullet roe, a veal chop with beans, grilled swordfish, asparagus 
            salad, and sauteed mixed vegetables, washed down with a couple of 
            bottles of Vermentio Funtana, a full-bodied but very drinkable 
            Sardinian white.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Everything was well prepared and 
            presented, fresh tasting, and complex, and both the diners and the 
            restaurant staff, all of them doing their jobs, made the experience 
            zesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>Restaurants like this communicate the message that it is <i

            time, to indulge, to consume in good cheer.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At 
            Canteen, on the other hand, the winner of a design award, popular 
            among office workers in the </SPAN><st1:place 
            ><span lang=EN-GB>East 
            End</SPAN></ST1:PLACE><span lang=EN-GB> – so 
            popular that we were told, coldly, that an hour and fifteen minutes 
            after being seated we would have to vacate our table for a party 
            that had reserved it – we got just the opposite message.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
            food, service, and ambience were all unpleasant: burnt 
            macaroni-cheese for me, run-of-the-mill fish and chips for Marion, 
            served peremptorily by a harried waiter after we had been ushered in 
            by the hostile host, and eaten on uncomfortable bench seats in a 
            sterile environment that would not have been out of place, except 
            for the high quality and finish of the materials, in the food court 
            of a upscale shopping mall in Minnesota.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>(The 
            owners of Canteen have since then opened several other outlets in

            >&nbsp; </SPAN>At a Wagamama, our meal was 
            pitiful: mushy noodles – overcooked instant noodles, the kind one 
            can buy dry in a styrofoam pot for under a pound – drowning in 
            condiments, prepared by cooks, as Marion put it in her log of the 
            evening, who had seen pictures of Asian noodle dishes but ‘had no 
            idea how they were supposed to taste.’<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>Certainly there was no resemblance between the thick, chewy, 
            lightly dressed fresh-pulled soba noodles I used to love for lunch 
            in </SPAN><st1:city><st1:place

            mixture of undercooked and overcooked vegetables swimming in bottled 
            sauce I received at Wagamama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>(It is not judgmental to say that 
            either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>The food was bad as a cold wet afternoon in November is bad.) 
            Acorn House was an exception, though not in all things.<span

            any other place we visited. It also exemplified the struggle of the

            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Situated in the Berkeley Hotel in 
            Knightsbridge (where single rooms start at £459 per night), it 
            looked comfortable and chic, an art nouveau – art deco establishment 
            with dark wood and velvet-clothed walls, high windows, brass 
            fittings, claret-coloured furnishings, and white linen 
            tablecloths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>It had an enormous wine list, 
            somewhat smugly featuring the red wines of Chateau Petrus (though 
            the food has no connection to the region, the <i 
            >terroir</I>, or the people who work at the 
            chateau), and a complex tasting menu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>It also had a special lunch menu, 
            three courses featuring either a pork or a beef dish, for thirty 
            pounds a person, which was about as much as we could afford.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And as I

            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Our 
            request was accepted, though only on condition that we leave a 
            credit card deposit and agree to the restaurant’s dress code, and 
            not wear jeans, or tennis shoes, or other proletarian paraphernalia.

            something auratically unique and famous and impressive, but we would

            construction of its differentness, we were gastronomic tourists in 
            search of aura, who were also, conversely if paradoxically, bringing

            performance of class, privilege, and glamour that, for all its 
            artificiality and pretentiousness, was neither insubstantial nor

            medium rare beef so fat and juicy one almost didn’t need to chew it; 
            for him twenty-four hour wine-braised belly pork (Americans would 
            call this a sideloin of pork), also served with its juices and baby 
            vegetables, the meat again very tender and in this case intensively 
            flavoured, as if wine and pork and vegetables had been combined and

            lang=EN-GB>, not to enjoy each course to its 
            full, with proper accoutrements, we decided to take a little splurge 
            on the wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"

            the way’).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>So we ordered half a bottle of white Jean-Max Roger 2005 
            Sancerre for the fish course, and to go with the meat and the rest a 
            full bottle of red burgundy, a 1998 Pernand-Vergelesses, indeed a 
            Premier Cru Laleure-Piot ‘Vergelesses’, which, though I (to my 
            shame) had never heard of either the winemaker or the type of wine 
            before, seemed a bargain at only fifty-nine pounds, since it was the 
            only impressive-sounding wine more than a few years old available at 
            less than seventy quid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>(Unlike Marion, however, who raved 
            about it, I was a bit disappointed by the results, finding the wine 
            to be a little too thin and fruity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>It was still perhaps a little

            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>For the 
            most part ignoring what in England are called ‘ethnic restaurants’, 
            not to mention fast food joints, and devoted to what Remy 
            unapologetically calls <i>tables 
            bourgeoises</I>, the Michelin system documents its own kind of 
            ‘continuity-in-variety’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Although regional variations 
            abound throughout France, the Michelin system presumes that they all

            in classical cosmology, and the presumption is not entirely 
            wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            cafe-restaurants and bistros that don’t make it into the <i 
            >Guide</I>, and from Brittany to the Côte d’Azur 
            (and perhaps all the way to Corsica), most of the dining out 
            establishments in France serve what is justifiably thought to be 
            ‘French food’, a single <i>kind </I>of food with

            idiosyncratically or regionally varied the bistro or the relais may 
            prove to be – so that everywhere in France steak frites inevitably 
            ends up on the menu, along with a regional or traditional <i

            one is able, willing, and knowledgeable enough to pay (call this 
            knowledgeableness ‘cultural capital’, if you will) so that the 
            well-to-do and fashionable set in London subsist on an almost

            consumption in modern day Britain, if such a place exists at all, is 
            to be found not in the places where it eats but in the places where 
            it drinks, and even the public house industry (with the spread of

            </SPAN>We discovered a pointed example of this in one of the first 
            places we visited, the celebrated Acorn House.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>An 
            outgrowth of Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen project, Acorn House is at once 
            a commercial institution and a charitable trust, which trains chefs 
            from disadvantaged backgrounds and serves reduced price meals to 
            agency employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Its main mission is both 
            ecological and aesthetic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>It wants to provide food with 
            minimal waste and maximum sustainability, producing the lowest 
            possible carbon footprint, using only locally sourced and seasonal 
            ingredients; and it wants to do all that on the ground floor of an 
            office block at the side of a drab and busy thoroughfare, near 
            King’s Cross, while both providing cheap meals for employees and 
            competing for the custom of fussy Londoners capable of spending 
            thirty quid a head or more for a meal.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It has 
            its own compost heaps and vegetable plot on the roof of the office 
            building, and only the most eco-friendly of equipment, furnishings, 
            and fittings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>It gets its cooking oil from rape 
            seed grown within a hundred miles or so of the centre of London, its 
            pork and artichokes from even closer, its table water (with low 
            energy filtration) from the tap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Though rather late in the day by 
            international standards, given the examples from way back of<span

            aiming to create a new infrastructure of restaurant service.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
            sourcing of ingredients, the developing of the work force, the 
            management of the home economy of the establishment, and even the 
            financial structure are all new and unique.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
            cuisine too, though based on traditional Italian principles, is 
            somewhat new.</SPAN></P>

            </SPAN>Our meal there, taken in a sleek, open and inviting dining 
            room, with light green furnishings along with lots of wood, was all 
            about vegetables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>We ordered from the ‘Menu for 
            March’, the only menu available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>I started with a rich beetroot and 
            cardamon soup, </SPAN><st1:city><st1:place

            >Marion</SPAN></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span

            concoction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>I then had grilled sea bream 
            served on a bed of two items from a so-called salad menu, borlotti 
            beans and artichokes, and Marion had roasted guinea fowl au jus 
            served on a bed of three other salad items, celeriac, salsify, and 
            spring cabbage with pancetta. </SPAN></P>

            >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>The flavours of every item were fresh, assertive but 
            balanced, and every item too was cooked exactly <i 
            >à point</I> – which is to say, at just the right 
            amount of doneness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>The beetroot soup tasted of beets; 
            the guinea fowl roast, which was hot, unctuous and moist all the way 
            through, tasted of fowl, and was slightly gamy.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This was 
            no supermarket chicken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>The salads were stars in their own 
            right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>We especially enjoyed the salsify, a root vegetable we had 
            not had much experience with before, its flavour and texture 
            something between celery, parsnip, and asparagus.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>These 
            ‘salad’ items, slightly vinegary and garlicky in taste, added 
            lightness, contrast, and variety to the heavy meat of the guinea 
            fowl and the dense fish flavours of the sea bream.</SPAN></P>
            <p class=MsoNormal

            >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>But of course they are not really ‘salad’ items, in the 
            Italian sense of the word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>They were not <i 
            >insalate; </I>they were <i 
            >verdure</I> and <i 
            >fagioli</I>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>And though classic Italian cuisine 
            might serve any of them as antipasti, it would never serve them, at 
            room temperature, with an oil and vinegar dressing, as an 
            accompaniment to a large portion of hot animal flesh or fish.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Though 
            everything on the menu (apart from some classically Northern 
            European soups and deserts) was Italian, the dinner itself was 
            something else; it was an innovation, and yet another hybrid 
            affair.</SPAN></P>

            </SPAN>Not that there is anything wrong with that, as a character on 
            <i>Seinfeld</I> might say.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But the 
            very success of what Acorn House is doing betrays the contradictions 
            inherent in modern </SPAN><st1:city><st1:place

            >London</SPAN></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span 
            lang=EN-GB> cookery. Here, in a restaurant 
            devoted to local sourcing (and that in the midst of the largest 
            conurbation in Europe), the items themselves were often of foreign 
            provenance – Italian beans, African guinea fowl, not to mention 
            olive oil and charcuterie from Italy and what is openly acknowledged 
            to be dairy products from Norway and France.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most of 
            the cookery was foreign too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>And yet again, here in a 
            restaurant devoted to Italian principles, the meals themselves were 
            put together in a non-Italian way, an Acorn House way.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>(Nor for 
            that matter, were there any Italians on staff, as far as we could 
            tell.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>Acorn House was not only trying to promote not only a new 
            ecology of restaurant management, but a new way of putting meals 
            together, a new way of eating, which mimicked Italian traditions but 
            also violated them in favour of something less conventional and 
            ceremonial.</SPAN></P>
            <p class=MsoNormal

            >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>And it was doing it, again, by establishing what amounted to 
            a new infrastructure of food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>Acorn House was meant to be not 
            just a restaurant, but an institution with an identity, and it was 
            meant to have an identity that not only branded it, giving it an 
            image attractive to customers, but that also&nbsp;laid down an 
            economy of restauration, from organic rape seed farmers in Essex to 
            compost pits on a rooftop in King’s Cross.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is 
            all very heroic, and I wish them the best.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But it 
            also amounts to a phenomenon Andrew Ross (1991) once called 
            attention to on the subject of New Age science.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>An 
            alternative to establishment science, New Age science is 
            counter-cultural, oppositional, even revolutionary.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But in 
            its attempts to oppose the establishment, it ends up mimicking 
            it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>No practice is more capitalistic, entrepreneurial, and 
            consumerist than New Age science, with its alternative publishing 
            houses, medical facilities, health products, trade shows, and 
            boutiques.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>And the same thing could be said about the New Age innovation 
            called Acorn House.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>If it is trying to revolutionise 
            the way people eat,&nbsp;though in a counter-cultural spirit, it is 
            in fact doing no more no less than what most successful new ventures 
            in </SPAN><st1:city><st1:place

            >London</SPAN></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span 
            lang=EN-GB> do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>The fuss about London, over and 
            above the unfortunate facts that most food in London is still not 
            very good, and most Londoners still eat poorly (on which see 
            Blythman, 2006) stems from the un-centred, un-hierarchical energy of 
            the London food scene: every new successful restaurateur in London 
            is trying to reinvent London cookery, trying to bring forth, out of 
            the Darwinian jungle of the London food scene, a new and dominant 
            species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>But the first commandment of </SPAN><st1:city 
            ><st1:place><span lang=EN-GB 
            >London</SPAN></ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY><span 
            lang=EN-GB> cookery isn’t then to ‘make it 
            good’, but something much more ambitious.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is 
            biblical, even: ‘Go forth and multiply!’</SPAN></P>

            </SPAN>Talking to Jay Rayner at the <i 
            style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Observer</I> 
            (2007: 63) head chef Arthur Potts made all of this very clear.<span 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>‘We 
            won’t buy from just anyone’, Potts said, speaking of his suppliers 
            of beets and vodka and cheese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>‘They have to be willing to fit in 
            with what we are doing here.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
            >&nbsp; </SPAN>But that shouldn’t be difficult, 
            Potts went on to say, in spite of the evidence of the thousands of 
            other restaurants and take-away joints in the vicinity of
