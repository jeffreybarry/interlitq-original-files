              the centre, a young woman in three quarter profile, her face hidden 
              by her abundant glossy hair, stands on a small mound and looks off 
              to the right. Next to her, the only mass of black in the entire 
              image, the misshapen trunk of a large tree whose branches are cut 
              off by the top edge of the photo. A sense of peace pervades the 
              scene.</span></p>
            <p class="texto">What is the woman looking at? Her right arm hangs 
              at her side, yet her hand is held slightly in front of her and her 
              fist appears to be clenched, though it is difficult to see clearly 
              as a leafy sapling half hides it.</p></td>

              is wearing a sweater of some light colour (the photo is black and 
              white) and a white skirt, smooth around the upper part of her buttocks 
              and pleated below, which barely reaches to her knees. </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="texto">The light catches the backs of her strong 
              shapely legs and her bare feet, the left leg and foot half hidden 
              by the right. Her heels are slightly higher than her toes, though 
              she is not standing on tiptoe, her body seems far too relaxed for 
              that. <br>
              <br>
              Silence. Peace.<br>
              <br>
              Beneath her feet, more leaves. Yet she does not appear to be standing 
              on a bed of leaves. In fact, now he looks more closely he sees that 
              there is a clear gap between her feet and the floor of the forest. 
              She must, he suddenly realises, be hanging from a branch of the 
              large tree, that is the only explanation, although the cord from 
              which she hangs is lost in the leaves and branches, and her abundant 
              hair, which falls to her shoulders, hides the noose around her neck. 
            </p>
            <p align="left" class="texto">Now he understands what it is he is 
              seeing he can sense how her body would move, turning a little this 
              way and that in the breeze, were there a breeze in this silent, 
              sunlit forest.</p>
