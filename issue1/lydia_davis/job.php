            <p>I lived in Buenos Aires for two months in the summer of 1965, when 
              I was just turning eighteen. My memories of that time, though sparse 
              and fragmented, remained vivid, and a year later, after my first 
              year of college, I wrote a short story set in the city as I remembered 
              it and depicting the sort of life I thought I could imagine there.</p>
            <p>It was a city of friendly and courteous people, tasty and abundant 
              food, vibrant culture&#8212;the fifth largest city in the world, 
              commonly called the <i>Paris of South America</i>, with broad avenues, 
              handsome parks and public buildings, including the spectacular <i>Teatro 
              Col&oacute;n</i>, and mansions in the style of 18th-century France 
              alongside a tremendous growth of high-rise apartment and office 
              buildings. </p>

        <tr> 
          <td colspan="4" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="texto2"> <span class="texto">It 
            was also a city of shattered and rubble-choked sidewalks, recurring 
            brief and unannounced strikes, nightly cut-offs of telephone service, 
            complex and inefficient bureaucracy, and a rather casual attitude 
            toward scheduled appointments. The leftist students in particular 
            were a powerful political force, and, at the time, because Lyndon 
            Johnson had recently escalated U.S. involvement in Vietnam and, more 
            shocking, sent Marines to repress the Santo Domingo uprising, there 
            was considerable anti-U.S. sentiment, although this rarely extended 
            to my family personally.</span> <p> <span class="texto">I was oblivious, 
              for the most part, of the political situation. I spent my days practicing 
              the violin, attending dance classes, working in a Catholic orphanage, 
              studying Spanish, going to concerts with my mother, taking walks 
              by myself, and writing in my journal. I observed the caged chickens 
              in the markets, talked in halting Spanish to butchers and embassy 
              guards, and wrote descriptions of the mist-filled city parks at 
              night and the glimpses, through the windows of private houses, of 
              &#8220;gray heads&#8221; bent over their tea. I was interested in 
              what was exotic to me: a gypsy girl selling lemons on the sidewalk, 
              the wheels of horse-drawn delivery carts twinkling in the sunlight, 
              a <i>gaucho</i> roasting whole goats in a restaurant window; but 
              I missed my friends and did not always know what to do with myself.</span></p>
            <p> <span class="texto">Recently, I read Marguerite Feitlowitz&#8217;s 
              <i>A Lexicon of Terror: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture</i>, 
              a meticulously researched account of Argentina&#8217;s &#8220;Dirty 
              War&#8221; that is at once riveting and frightening. The Dirty War 
              began in 1976 but was made possible by a succession of earlier <i>coups 
              </i>and political upheavals beginning as far back as June of 1966. 
              One particularly disturbing section of the book depicts the surface 
              normality of daily life in the city of Buenos Aires&#8212;the bustle 
              of the city streets, the cheerful shopping expeditions, the festive 
              dinners&#8212;that continued even as the prolonged imprisonment 
              and torture of &#8220;subversives&#8221; was being carried out, 
              often only a few feet away. This was not a country at war, and those 
              carrying out the torture were often enough fond fathers and husbands. 
              I then looked again at my family&#8217;s stay in Buenos Aires and 
              saw it in a different light, as though the horror of the events 
              that would follow in the not-so-distant future loomed already over 
              the city, as though the geography of sidewalks, streets, houses, 
              public buildings in which we took part in the normal life of the 
              city were itself already less innocent. <br>
              <br>
              <i>Ways</i> was written in the summer of 1966, when I was nineteen, 
              for a fiction workshop led by Grace Paley during a summer session 
              at Columbia University. (Fiction workshops were much less common 
              in those days, and this was the only one I ever enrolled in.) I 
              reproduce it here more or less as it was written: I have corrected 
              a few spelling mistakes (e.g. &#8220;boothes,&#8221; &#8220;tableclothes,&#8221; 
              and some of the Spanish words); changed the spelling of Louis (English 
              or French) to Luis (Spanish); and reduced the capacity of the opera 
              house from 12,000 to 3,000. If it were my choice now, I would not 
              title the story <i>Ways</i>, which is vague and unexciting. </span>

              <i>Ways</i></p>
            <p class="texto">This afternoon the wind blew in gusts along the street. 
              The women&#8217;s cheeks warmed with color, their hair tousled, 
              the men spread their woven and fringed scarves over their shoulders. 
              Today was Sunday, the fruit stands boarded up, gratings lowered 
              on all the store fronts. As the afternoon darkened there were only 
              a few breaks in the dusk in each block; a <i>confiter&iacute;a</i> 
              on the corner with its glass doors closed, men inside leaning over 
              their tea, their scarves rumpled against their collars, their hands 
              gesturing or cradling their cups in the cold and white light. Here 
              and there along the street trays and tiers of candy flowered from 
              booths between the stores. Curtaining above them hung lines of tickets 
              for the national lottery. The proprietor sat reading a folded newspaper 
              on a stool behind the counter. On the corner across the street from 
              the <i>confiter&iacute;a </i>a neon sign glowed down the front of 
              a <i>parrilla</i>, where grilled beefsteaks were sold.</p>
            <p class="texto">The old man crossed over the cobblestones of the 
              street to look in at the <i>parrilla</i>. Its white tablecloths 
              glimmered and a few white-jacketed <i>mozos</i> stood talking behind 
              the bar. Just after dark: people would not begin arriving until 
              nine. Peering in the window, his eyes sparkled a moment under his 
              heavy eyebrows. Slowly he put his hands to his collar and turned 
              it up. Away from the window he folded his hands across the soft 
              ends of his shawl, paused a moment, and walked on.</p>
            <p class="texto">Such a very difficult matter to decide, he began 
              to think. I do not want him in the house with me. He is not quiet 
              like an old man, and he eats and drinks a great deal. He would never 
              be content with a little omelette and vegetable. He frowned and 
              then thought of other things. Should he take tea there on the corner 
              or go on home and have a little <i>mat&eacute;</i>? He walked along 
              slowly and imagined each experience carefully. It comforted him 
              to hold the silver <i>mat&eacute;</i> cup in his palms, to stir 
              the leaves about with the long silver strainer. To sit quiet with 
              his considerations, with his own damp and undisturbed smell, with 
              the noises he was accustomed to, the clanging of elevator gates 
              in the hall beyond the door and an occasional drift of voices, the 
              ticking of a small alarm clock in his room, the other rooms silent. 
              He could sit at the kitchen table with <i>La Prensa</i> folded before 
              him and look again at the review of Ricci&#8217;s first appearance 
              in the city. It was comfortable to suck up the hot bitter drink 
              while he read about the brilliant cadenza that opened the Ginastera 
              concerto, while he remembered the perfect intonation of the violin. 
              Ricci seemed alone there on the edge of the stage, with the orchestra 
              silent behind him. The old man frowned again and rubbed his hands 
              across his eyes; he was ashamed and humiliated when he couldn&#8217;t 
              stop coughing. He wanted to hear every sequence and every interval, 
              but he wheezed and choked. Three thousand others were quiet. He 
              said angrily to himself, I am an old fool spoiling the music.<br>
              &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="texto">The old man crossed over the cobblestones to the 
              <i>confiteria</i>. The glass door didn¡t open easily; bending his 
              head he pushed the door, forwards and back a few times until a young 
              man coming out swung it inwards. The old man stumbled and looked 
              up against the light. The young man was about thirty. He eyes opened 
              for a moment in surprise and he started to murmur <i>&quot;Perd&oacute;n&quot;</i>. 
              Then he looked irritated.</p>
            <p class="texto">&#8220;<i>Papa</i>, what are you doing?&#8221;<br>
              The old man&#8217;s eyes watered from the smoke and light and he 
              looked down.<br>
              &#8220;<i>Papa,</i> do you want me to come to the house later this 
              night, after you have eaten?&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Yes, yes Luis. Come and we&#8217;ll talk about it,&#8221; 
              the old man answered.<br>
              Sitting at a table by the dark window the old man cupped the tea 
              between his palms and looked out at the bus stop. The first swallow 
              of tea flowed comfortably over his throat, his cold fingers curled 
              newly sensitive around the warm china. He saw life as isolated moments 
              like this of particular pleasure or pain or embarrassment. A small 
              Indian boy came into the crowd of tables with a sheaf of newspapers. 
              He called out &#8220;<i>Diario, La Prensa</i>.&#8221; The old man 
              put ten <i>pesos</i> in the boy&#8217;s hand and laid the newspaper 
              on his lap. Another moment, another picture silenced the talk around 
              him and took him out beyond the city, through dripping streets near 
              the river.</p>
            <p class="texto">Once when Luis was younger he had forgotten his father 
              at a tea party and driven away with some friends. The old man had 
              insisted on walking back into the city through the wet suburb. He 
              walked in a vast stillness, in the dark after a rainfall. He passed 
              houses and bramble-filled vacant lots where the path was mud, where 
              logs and pieces of metal tripped him. At the crossroads a lake had 
              gathered and reflected one lamp that swayed in the wind above it. 
              Across the railroad tracks the call &#8220;<i>Diario</i>&#8221; 
              had been the only sound. Stillness swallowed the voice again and 
              again. Many streets over, it passed behind him.</p>
            <p class="texto">Another sip of tea lost itself in the old man&#8217;s 
              mouth. His breath caught in his throat and he struggled for air. 
              Choking, he coughed again and again; wind rasped down his throat 
              and his chest ached. Tea from his cup splashed onto his wrist and 
              his eyes filled with tears. He set the cup in its saucer and with 
              a leaf-like paper napkin wiped the back of his hand and his lips. 
              At the tables close by a few women watched nervously the old man 
              looking guiltily up with his wet eyes, his crown bare and his nose 
              arched down at this tea. His hands dabbed at the spilt tea and groped 
              in his pockets for some change. The <i>mozo</i> stopped by his table 
              and collected ten <i>pesos</i> from him, carried away the empty 
              cup and the wet napkin, and the old man got up and left.</p>
            <p class="texto">The vague worry clouded his mind again. Some decision 
              he must make, something hard to face. The streets lay deserted now. 
              Electric buses passed, their two long rods attached to two wires 
              over the street, sizzling and sparking when the wires crossed. Old-fashioned 
              taxi-cabs blinked their headlights bright and dim, white and yellow, 
              as they trundled around the curve with red <i>libre</i> signs in 
              their front windows. The old man remembered that Luis wanted to 
              move in to live with him. He must decide now. He pushed the button 
              at the corner for the light to change. As he stood with his hand 
              resting on the post his throat thickened again, his knees weakened. 
              As the coughs cracked in his throat the signal turned red and one 
              by one the cars drew up to the left and the right. His chest rose 
              and fell and his forehead dampened. No one noticed; the cars began 
              blinking their lights and honking their horns. The coughs shook 
              him. At last the traffic started slowly up in a mass and then drifted 
              apart. His saliva tasted bitter.</p>
            <p class="texto">At home, the old man found a little blood on his 
              collar and was disturbed that his good coat might be spoiled. There 
              was enough wine for Luis later. An extra bottle in the laundry closet, 
              standing in the cold under the stone sink and hanging net bags. 
              Sitting at the kitchen table his eyes strayed over the <i>Gu°a Musical</i> 
              in the paper and read a notice for &#8220;Martha Argerich <i>y</i> 
              Ruggiero Ricci&#8221; to play tomorrow in the T<i>eatro Col&oacute;n</i>. 
              Ah, Ricci again. The girl Martha, though, had not impressed him. 
              She had taken the difficult passages too fast. The old man pushed 
              the paper aside. He felt a little foolish to take so much interest 
              in the music now when he wouldn¡t be hearing any more of it. He 
              didn¡t see where the money would come from now to pay for the food 
              Luis ate, and the electricity when Luis stayed up with his friends. 
              The <i>frigor&iacute;fico</i>, the meat-freezing plant, had closed 
              down for lack of beef and Luis had nothing to live on.</p>
            <p class="texto">The apartment grew colder and damp as it became time 
              to prepare supper. The old man rubbed the spot off his coat collar 
              with cold water and plugged the electric heater into the living 
              room wall. Foolish man that his son was, he thought, that he never 
              trained himself for anything better than a meat-packer. An upright 
              piano darkened one corner of the room. Its keys were chipped and 
              the strings inside rotted away or tightened and broke. the old man 
              touched a chord that lay easily under his hand. Only one note sounded 
              distantly.</p>
            <p class="texto">Out of the refrigerator he took a cloudy glass of 
              red wine and a thick bowl of cold string beans. He washed a large 
              green apple and peeled it expertly in dangling circles over his 
              plate. When Luis was two years old he used to chew the end of the 
              peel as it looped perfectly from the knife. My fingers have not 
              changed. My teeth are still strong. The difference is that I am 
              frightened of not knowing about things. Slices of the apple fell 
              onto the plate, and seeds and stem dropped beside them. Luis was 
              a strong boy when he was two, and a cross baby. When his mother 
              stopped nursing him at seven months his eyes were always sleepy 
              and he had a crest of soft hair on his head.</p>
            <p class="texto">Luis had grown up strange and unknown now, a full 
              man who would be angry often and for no reason if they lived together. 
              But a son could not be denied. The old man filled a kettle with 
              water and lit the stove. He would drink <i>mat&eacute;</i> and Luis 
              would have wine. Perhaps they would be friendly and everything settled. 
              It had been a long time since they had spent an evening talking. 
              He put the kettle over the flame and cleared away the apple peelings.</p>
            <p class="texto">The old man looked critically at the kitchen, at 
              all the dust gathered in corners, stains on the floor, <i>cucurrachas</i> 
              running now and then along the baseboards behind the sink, at what 
              might be changed with Luis here. The tired old things that worked 
              falteringly under his hand might break under Luis&#8217;. A big 
              man who draped sides of beef over his back, who gripped the long 
              bloody shoulders in his hands, in uniform hooded like an Arab, couldn&#8217;t 
              live in a small, old man&#8217;s way.</p>
            <p class="texto">The doorbell from downstairs buzzed by the refrigerator 
              and the old man dropped the <i>mat&eacute;</i> leaves he held in 
              a spoon. He let Luis in. The small gourd laced with silver shook 
              as he filled it. The elevator gate slammed shut in the front hall. 
              He set out the bottle of wine and washed the dust out of a red glass. 
              The water began boiling and he took it off the flame as Luis came 
              in.</p>
            <p class="texto">&#8220;<i>Hola</i>,&#8221; said the son as he sat 
              down in front of the wine, unzipping his brown leather jacket. &#8220;Did 
              you eat enough supper? How are you?&#8221; He frowned up at the 
              old man.<br>
              &#8220;Yes, yes. I am all right,&#8221; the old man answered and 
              waited for his son to talk.<br>
              Steam rose as the hot water tumbled into the round-bottomed gourd 
              that rested on a little stand.<br>
              &#8220;Have some wine.&#8221; The old man replaced the kettle on 
              the stove and turned to watch his son whisk a finger around inside 
              the rim of the glass and pour out a dollop of red wine with one 
              quick tipping of his arm. His hair was greased and combed back, 
              his eyes under the kitchen light were in shadow. His cheeks were 
              rough and his lower lip lay full and curving.</p>
            <p class="texto">&#8220;<i>Papa</i>, sit down and drink your <i>mat&eacute;</i>. 
              What&#8217;s the matter with you? Are you sick again? Tell me.&#8221;<br>
              The old man sat down and began to stir his drink with the long silver 
              rod. His hands felt the warmth of the gourd, but his mind thought 
              of other things. What was it Luis asked? His health.<br>
              &#8220;No, it goes a little better with me now.&#8221; The rod became 
              warmer between his fingers as he tried to think of how to tell Luis 
              to stay with him. If he told him the right way there was a chance 
              of starting their life together peacefully. But his mind jumped 
              nervously, watching Luis lower his lips to the wine, watching the 
              light run down the creases of his jacket. He must think.</p>
            <p class="texto">Luis was looking at him again. The old man watched 
              him tighten his lips, watched him try to control his words. The 
              younger man was nervous too, but with irritation, with wanting to 
              be somewhere else.<br>
              &#8220;<i>Papa</i>, stop stirring your <i>mat&eacute;</i>. It will 
              be too strong for you.&#8221;<br>
              The old man said nothing and stopped.<br>
              &#8220;I thought you didn&#8217;t like it strong.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Luis, I want you to live with me. I think that would be all 
              right.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;<i>Por fin</i>.&#8221; Luis smiled tightly and shook his 
              father by the shoulder. &#8220;<i>Ah, bueno, Papa</i>. Listen to 
              me then.&#8221; He looked heavy and worried and reckless, zipping 
              up his jacket.<br>
              &#8220;<i>Bueno</i>. Tonight I am going to see some friends. Tomorrow 
              I will see you. Tomorrow we will talk some more. Are you happy? 
              Have you something to do?&#8221;<br>
              The old man nodded.<br>
              &#8220;Why are you so quiet? Why haven&#8217;t you more to say? 
              We will lead our own lives, we will share the same roof. We won&#8217;t 
              bother each other.&#8221; He frowned down at the table. As he stood 
              his head was just under the light and his face in shadow.<br>
              &#8220;Well,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;I did say enough. I 
              said what you wanted me to say and it is all settled now, isn&#8217;t 
              it?&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Luis, and left. </p>
            <p class="texto">The old man was breathing quickly. It exhausted him 
              to be angry. His knees weakened and he leaned down over the table 
              with his knuckles on the wood.</p>
            <p class="texto">The wind rose after eleven and rattled the doors 
              in all the apartments. The Southern Cross lay in the black sky. 
              The crackle and blue light of the electric buses came from the street. 
              The newspaper boy called the late night edition. </p>
