              excuses the odd unfortunate event</p>
            <p class="texto2">preferring power, the work of the broad brush,<br>

              on clean laundry and a regular wash.<br>
              <br>
              History&#8217;s inches are icons of long distance,<br>

              requiring neither comment nor assistance</p>
            <p class="texto2">from those citing individual rights<br>
              as their excuse. The child lies in its bed<br>
              watching light shift while days and nights</p>
            <p class="texto2"> succeed each other, wholly unassisted.<br>
              desire begins and loss. Music swells<br>

              old,<br>
              turns towards the camera and smiles back<br>
              at the photographer. It is the controlled</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">moment. It is Vermeer and Goya, the crack<br>
              between great landmasses of becoming,<br>
              almost an elsewhere, the point where the track<br>
              <br>
              becomes visible as it vanishes, numbing<br>
              and quickening. You can see the earlier face<br>
              and read the later one. Time keeps drumming</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">its fingers impatient with being in one place<br>
              so long, but here it is now. Look. Just there<br>
              in the flash of the eye, in the faint trace</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">of foreknowledge we detect and seem to share<br>
              with her like hindsight or a guess<br>
              we must hazard because chance is everywhere.</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">Slowly the word &#8216;you&#8217; begins to

              her condition. You: the camera&#8217;s trick<br>
              of intimacy and numb tenderness.</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">So let us say you to her. You, says the click<br>
              of recognition. Yes that was the girl<br>

              conversation between images that unfurl</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">like flags to mark the spot where you nearly<br>
              stand at age nine, the future drawn towards you<br>
              determined never to see you as clearly</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">as the present can. Something is travelling 
              through<br>
              the grey veins of the grey print. I daren&#8217;t name it<br>
              because naming is too easy. Naming is what we do</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">when taking possession. We call it and so 
              claim it,<br>
              but the moment is unclaimed. The image is elsewhere.<br>
              Let somebody else develop it and frame it.</span></p>

            <p><span class="texto2">and flourishes, the flowing and the flown<br>
              merging into each other. Who can read<br>

            <p><span class="texto2">Threadbare capillaries tangle and bleed<br>
              under the skin of it. I&#8217;ll tell you who you are<br>

            <p><span class="texto2">I can twist round my finger. You are the avatar<br>

            <p><span class="texto2">as a body can fly. Beyond the thin grey line<br>

              and distance. It is impossible to escape</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">from it and see it whole. So you, my love, 
              know<br>
              no more than I do where we stand and hear<br>
              each other call by name whatever names shadow</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">in voices that waken, comfort and endear<br>
              themselves to us through their brokenness<br>

              the weight of invisible breasts behind the high<br>
              empire line and twist of cord; empty and fresh</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">as air. It is just waiting for you to try<br>
              the outfit on for size, to become woman<br>
              and fill it out without pondering the why</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">and how of it, to step into the common<br>
              form-hugging sheath and gracefully undertake<br>
              the obligations implied by such things. No-one<br>
              <br>
              goes naked in the world after all. For whose sake<br>
              do you become who you are? Are you alone<br>
              in the dark? Is it for yourself you ache</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">in the morning? Even if you were stone,<br>

            <p><span class="texto2">yet negotiable. As a child you respond<br>
              to the adult&#8217;s gravity with a blank stare<br>
              of instinctive hunger. You touch your blonde</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">hair and bunch it in your fist. You prepare<br>
              your flirtatious look. You play at control,<br>
              then lost, start crying at the small despair</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">you&#8217;re stuck with. But this is the soul<br>
              prepared for you, these garments that glow<br>
              in the dark and burn as fierce as coal.<br>
              <br>
              and out of the same dark step the slow<br>
              suitors in their allotted garments, unsure<br>
              of their own identities, hoping to follow</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">the patterns they&#8217;ve guessed at, a mature<br>
              untroubled roundness weighing at their hearts,<br>

            <p><span class="texto2">insisted they do so, as if there were darts<br>

              <span class="texto2">As a child you move slowly over the vast<br>
              floor of the kitchen, the almost endless yard,<br>

              <br>
              in the opposite direction. Once you discard<br>
              the walking frame you hurtle between handholds<br>

              <br>
              of responsibility. Girl and boy. The faint<br>

              of a time before time, an unfixed point in space<br>
              we could inhabit while the adult world rolled</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">past us, a story in which the desperate race<br>
              was internalised in the drumming sound<br>
              of pulses, settling forever behind the face<br>
              </span><span class="texto2"><br>
              we made at the precise moment we found<br>
              the hidden treasure, the lost child, the frog<br>
              turned prince, the giant or genie unbound</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">and risen, the terrifying saucer-eyed dog,<br>
              the witch with the metal nose, the very image<br>
              of Tycho Brahe found years later. Our dialogue</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">was with creatures requiring kindness and 
              courage.<br>
              We were not ourselves as seen in the looking glass,<br>
              not firmly definable, but a kind of mirage</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">that attended and haunted the back of the 
              class<br>
              when the teacher&#8217;s voice blurred into afternoon<br>
              and the sun had long slipped by under the grass</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">and the distant houses were gone or would 
              be soon<br>
              with their ghost inhabitants slipping in through open<br>
              windows, and the light above was a balloon</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">drifting to sleep. It was that time, when 
              time was broken<br>
              and piecemeal, that identity gained weight,<br>
              fleshed out. It is that time that is woken</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">in us when we seem to fall or gravitate<br>
              towards each other without knowing it,<br>
              a time that is both too early yet late</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">enough to be ourselves, the classroom lit<br>
              with eyes, the dream working its way through<br>
              troubled nerves, the nightbirds beginning to flit</span></p>
            <p><span class="texto2">from haze of branch to haze of branch and 
              the blue-<br>
              indigo of our lives solidifying into selves<br>

              <span class="texto2"> 8. A Time</span></strong><span class="texto2"><br>
              <br>
              Once upon a time when myths were still falling<br>
              about us like tall shadows, when you emerged<br>
              from infancy and heard the body calling</span></p>
            <p class="texto2">out of the fog of the street, and were urged<br>
              to follow, at first into the garden, and then<br>
              beyond the gate where the hormones surged<br>
              <br>
              like crowds of unruly children, half-grown men,<br>
              and gusts of sheer energy shook you into fear<br>
              and loneliness as is the way with children,</p>
            <p class="texto2">tumbling forward, so deep within your ear<br>
              you could feel the blood gathering then gone<br>
              south, into the world, in the spurt of desire.</p>
            <p class="texto2">Mechanics of growth: the yearning to be done<br>
              and out before desire is itself, no more<br>
              than pain, embarrassment, anticipation</p>
            <p class="texto2">of more pain, at the point where the door<br>
              snaps open, beyond the garden, out<br>
              in the street and beyond, beyond metaphor</p>
            <p class="texto2">into body, into flight, into squalor and doubt<br>
              and romance. The children run forwards<br>
              like troops into fire hearing a distant shout,</p>
            <p class="texto2">the gunfire of laughter and death. Whose words<br>
              are they speaking? Can you hear your own cry<br>
              in the strange cacophony or sound the chords</p>
            <p class="texto2">of the music where they are shouting? You lie<br>
              on your bed. The child is trickling painfully away,<br>
              passing into a future you yourself supply.</p>
            <p class="texto2">I watch from a distance as skinny girls play<br>
              among themselves, I am too young for this.<br>
              They move past me laughing. I must stay</p>
            <p class="texto2">in my childhood a while. Already I miss<br>
              you, the billowing forth that I anticipate<br>
              is not for me, not yet. I am waiting for your kiss.</p>

            <p class="texto2"><span class="texto2"><strong>9. The Birds</strong></span></p>
            <p class="texto2">Sometimes you see a shape that hovers in the eye<br>
              and lodges itself in the furniture of the mind,<br>
              part light, part sound, between silence, music and cry</p>
            <p class="texto2">that sings out of half-open drawers. You find<br>
              yourself staring at it through the bedroom door,<br>
              caught in the mirror, perfectly defined</p>
            <p class="texto2">like your own incomprehensible face but more<br>
              light, more sound. Sometimes I wake and stare<br>
              at you beside me as if on a foreign shore,</p>
            <p class="texto2">an object cast there, a figure of the air<br>
              locked into itself, strange, magical<br>
              and potent, a burden I can just about bear</p>
            <p class="texto2">to support without the heart breaking, as small<br>
              as this one moment in a universe without scale,<br>
              and, inside that bright moment, the sum of all</p>
            <p class="texto2">such moments, years, decades. Outside, frail<br>
              birds are beginning their morning ablution,<br>
              chirruping and squabbling, a musical Braille</p>
            <p class="texto2">that ears may trace and decipher in the commotion<br>
              as multiple layers of meaning, your face<br>
              more comprehensible than my own, the impression</p>
            <p class="texto2">of meaning everywhere as superfluous grace,<br>
              the windowsill, the sheets, the books by the bed,<br>
              the reflection lightly imprinted on the space</p>
            <p class="texto2">behind a chair, the crumpled clothes, the bedspread<br>
              with its foothills, its geologies. The universe<br>
              arrives at the station. The shape of your head</p>
            <p class="texto2">hangs in the vast forecourt where crowds disperse<br>
              and gather like dense flowers, where everything moves<br>
              forward beyond the street, where there is no reverse,</p>
            <p class="texto2">only, rarely, this blessed stasis: the light that 
              loves<br>
              you and holds you still. And slow as dreams,<br>
              birds rise from the roof, swifts, sparrows, thrushes, doves,</p>
            <p class="texto2">as they have always done, their shapes the phonemes<br>
              of a pure language. And you are there, beautiful<br>
              as their whistles and slurs, their trilling, their screams.</p>
