              <p>The novel  manuscript, yet to be published, was short listed for the 2007 inaugural Man  Asian Literary Prize.</p>
              <p><em>Early 1998, in the midst of the Asian economic crisis.  Gail Szeto, a divorced, forty-something, Eurasian investment banker from Hong  Kong, learns from her Filipino domestic helper Conchita, of her son&rsquo;s (Chak Gu  Kwun) and mother&rsquo;s (Mrs. Szeto) fatal accident while on a business trip in New  York.&nbsp; Gail&rsquo;s ex-husband is Hong Kong  Chinese, Jason Chak; her father is an American, Mark Ashberry, long deceased;  her parents never married.&nbsp; </em></p>
              <em>These two excerpts are from Chapters 2 &amp; 3. </em>

            <p>The Kowloon  public mortuary &mdash; an air conditioned stone shack, its entrance tucked away on a  side street in Hung Hom &mdash; was furnished like some civil service outpost.&nbsp; Ancient wooden benches and counters, chipped  at the edges, were enclosed by dirty walls.&nbsp;  Temporary, handwritten signs that directed visitors or proclaimed  regulations all awaited permanent replacements.</p>
            <p>Gail gulped down  an awful nausea.&nbsp; Upon stating her  business, a clerk yelled out to the back, &ldquo;You know, the real banged up <em>lo por </em>and kid.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
              <p>The workers who  wheeled them out wore filthy, blood-stained aprons and wooden clogs, like  butchers at the market.</p>
              <p>The corpses lay  on rusty metal beds.&nbsp; Both bore witness  to their violent end.&nbsp; Gu Kwun&rsquo;s face,  especially, was battered and barely recognizable.&nbsp; Mrs. Szeto&rsquo;s body had been badly crushed, but  her face emerged with only a few bruises and scratches.&nbsp; Even in death, vanity prevailed, as it had in  life.</p>
            <p>One worker  commented,&nbsp; &ldquo;They can fix them up,  especially the faces, real good you can hardly tell.&rdquo;&nbsp; All Gail could think of was that moment of  impact when her son flew, &ldquo;like an aeroplane&rdquo; she could hear him shout, the way  he would when they ran along the beach, and she turned away from the scarred  and crumpled faces, hiding her own in her hands.&nbsp; Someone said, <em>&ldquo;Chanyan, </em>right?&rdquo;</p>
 
              <p>Gail confirmed  Conchita&rsquo;s previous identification.&nbsp;  Jason had told the police it would be better if they waited for her to  return, and declined to come in.&nbsp; <em>Such cowardice, especially for a medical  doctor</em> . . . but the moment overwhelmed her indignation.&nbsp; In the jumble of feelings, she caught herself  thinking, wasn&rsquo;t it presumptuous of her maid to identify . . . but conceded,  albeit unwillingly, no, it was courageous of Conchita to have faced, alone,  this unkind bureaucracy, one that would have treated the Filipino, the  foreigner, with disdain. </p>
            <p>Interminable  paperwork followed, slowed by the minimal staff during this post-celebratory  period, as if the government did not expect death during public holidays.&nbsp; Gail experienced, once again, the quizzical  surprise of local bureaucrats when she, the <em>chanyan, </em>the relative, the &ldquo;intimate person,&rdquo; gave her name &mdash; she had no official  Chinese language name &mdash; while her son and mother only had Chinese names and no  English ones.&nbsp; <em>Jaap jung, </em>she could hear them think, as they noted her Eurasian  face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mixed species,&rdquo; a pejorative  silenced only by her native speaker&rsquo;s fluency in Cantonese.</p>
            <p>Gail asked about  funeral arrangements and was directed to Universal Funeral Parlor,  &ldquo;conveniently&rdquo; located next door in a macabre monopoly.&nbsp; The funeral director sized her up &mdash; <em>classy, moneyed &mdash;</em> and after a few phone  calls, advised that the crematorium could slot her in <em>almost immediately</em> because <em>their</em> expeditor was there<em> on the spot</em> the  minute the new openings and times were announced, thanks to numerous years of  dealing with that government office.&nbsp;  Otherwise, it might be <em>several</em> more days before she could get an opening.&nbsp;  He nodded obsequiously, murmuring, <em>Ms.  Szeto understands about these things, doesn&rsquo;t she, </em>the expectation of a  large tip abundantly clear.</p>
              <p>The whole process  disgusted Gail.</p>
 
              <p>For a moment, she  wondered whether or not to hold the funeral on the island, in North Point for  instance, since that was closer to where her family lived on Stubbs Road.&nbsp; At least, that was where Gail wanted to live  when she and Jason returned to Hong Kong.&nbsp;  Yet Jason had gone &ldquo;home&rdquo; with his new wife to Kowloon where they both  grew up, just as her mother wanted to return home to Kowloon City.&nbsp; We belong to<em> dai luk,</em> the &ldquo;big continent,&rdquo; her mother used to say, meaning  Mainland China, the tiny  slice of land at its tip comprising Kowloon  peninsula and the New Territories where most of Hong   Kong&rsquo;s population resided.&nbsp;  In the end, she decided it didn&rsquo;t really matter &ndash; she too was from  Kowloon originally even if her son wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; and it was the last thing she need  ever do for her mother.</p>
            <p>That afternoon,  driving home in the underwater harbor tunnel towards the island, Gail wanted,  for one wild second, to crash through the curved metal wall into the sea.&nbsp; All her family, gone.&nbsp; There was no one, <em>not a single person,</em> to worry about any longer.</p>
              <p>Daylight loomed  near at the exit.&nbsp; She gripped the  steering wheel, willing control.</p><br>
            <p align="center">***</p>
            <p>During the wake,  every time Gail glanced at the enlarged photo of her son, she wished she had  chosen a different one.&nbsp; One that made  his nose look less flat and his hair a little less unyielding in its  straightness.&nbsp; Of the teachers and  students at International, only Janie and her father came to pay respects, as  Conchita predicted.&nbsp; This Chinese funeral  might have seemed alien to some at the elite private school Gu Kwun attended,  where an American curriculum was designed for Westernized locals and  foreigners.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>This funeral,  Gail knew, was entirely for Mom.</p>
            <p>Around Gail, the  last of her mother&rsquo;s dance hall girlfriends, those perennial strangers of her  childhood, wept.&nbsp; Each woman separately  forced upon Gail an envelope of money.&nbsp;  They wanted to contribute to funeral expenses for their <em>daijeih, </em>the oldest among them who was  accorded the privileged &ldquo;eldest sister&rdquo; status.</p>
              <p>Number one <em>A-Yi </em>prattled besides Gail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were going to  have a big celebration for her eightieth birthday this year,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you know that, <em>Gay-lo?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em>All these women had  trouble saying &ldquo;Gail,&rdquo; the American name her mother insisted on, forgoing a  Chinese one, desperate as she had been to win her lover&rsquo;s approval in the  mistaken belief that this would make him leave his wife and marry her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  Gail replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yeah, we were  planning one.&nbsp; At the &lsquo;Spring River&rsquo;s  Tide&rsquo; restaurant, you remember, the one near your old place?&nbsp; We were going to order double boiled shark&rsquo;s  fin, and bird&rsquo;s nest for dessert.&nbsp; She  loved all that stuff.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t the  woman shut up?&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of  you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she would have appreciated  it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were going to  ask you to lend her to us for a day and we&rsquo;d have taken care of her.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re just like family.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why she promised to look after me, you  know.&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped abruptly.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t meant to bring that up, especially  here.&nbsp; Luckily, Gail didn&rsquo;t seem to have  heard and she gushed on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to  see you again, my <em>daijeih&rsquo;s </em>girl!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Number one <em>A-Yi, </em>who penned all the letters from  her illiterate mother during the sixteen years Gail lived in the U.S., might  easily have been a real aunt.&nbsp; All the  women were elderly, except for their outfits, the too-fancy shoes and shiny  clothes.&nbsp; Nightlife hovered around them  like an unrelenting spirit, the way it had around Mom.&nbsp; Gail observed how the funeral director  greeted these women&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; <em>So that&rsquo;s what she was,</em> his eyes  sneered, for all the daughter&rsquo;s respectable airs. </p>
            <p>The mourning room  was on the third floor on a side wing, larger rooms being located off the main  corridor.&nbsp; Set against a stage wall, the  Buddhist altar was garishly red and gold, horribly loud.&nbsp; Hanging in the center, framed by a border of  white chrysanthemums, were the two black-and-white photographs of Mom and Gu  Kwun.&nbsp; Incense perfumed the air.&nbsp; Two mourners wailed &mdash; the funeral director  had looked askance at the paltry number &mdash; their robed bodies swaying as if  buffeted by a persistent wind.</p>
              <p>To the left of  the altar was the chilled room for the bodies.&nbsp;  The temperature there was only slightly cooler than in the main  room.&nbsp; The air conditioner rattled; in  summer, it would be unbearable.&nbsp; Gu  Kwun&rsquo;s face looked almost like his photograph, although the make up couldn&rsquo;t  completely disguise the disfigurement.&nbsp;  Gail&rsquo;s mother simply looked asleep.</p>
            <p>Nothing, however,  could disguise the utilitarian aspect of the place.&nbsp; The room&rsquo;s tiled floor and unintentional  fifties-retro design presented an unclean mosaic.&nbsp; Traces of the metal frame&rsquo;s putrid beige  paint smeared the glass, an interior glass door for light, but also for staff  to peer in and keep things on schedule.&nbsp;  The store on the second floor sold Buddhist, Christian and Taoist  funereal trappings, and the multi-purpose altar could be re-decorated, within  minutes, into the stage of the required faith.</p>
            <p>All morning long,  her mother&rsquo;s friends came to pay respects.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Such a dear, sweet woman, so generous,&rdquo; they murmured in turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t deserve to die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gail hadn&rsquo;t anticipated this many  people.&nbsp; How had <em>A-Yi </em>gotten the word out so fast?&nbsp;  Much to the funeral director&rsquo;s consternation, Gail hadn&rsquo;t prepared  enough money packets to give everyone and had to scramble as people left &mdash; all  expected the ritual token. </p>
              <p>Gail did not  recognize most of the visitors.&nbsp; These  dancers, policewomen and men, waiters, cooks, bartenders, gambling and massage  parlor folks, a pawnbroker &mdash; all from Kowloon City, their old neighborhood &mdash;  befriended her mother after Gail left for college in the U.S.&nbsp; Only her <em>A-Yi&rsquo;s </em>were familiar<em>, </em>the retired  &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; from the dance hall who had taken turns watching her on their off  evenings, the nights Mom worked.&nbsp; Number  seven <em>A-Yi</em>, the youngest, was in her  sixties.&nbsp; Number four had died  young.&nbsp; An unlucky number, four, homonym  for death.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Only the <em>A-Yi&rsquo;s </em>stayed the entire morning.</p>
              <p>Number one <em>A-Yi </em>pressed a cell phone number into  her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can reach me now,  anytime, even when I&rsquo;m out and about.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Gail murmured the  socially acceptable response.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  too good to me,&rdquo; and stuck the slip of paper into her purse. </p>
            <p>Conchita stopped  in briefly, saying she would offer a mass for the dead at her church.&nbsp; Gail&rsquo;s office sent a wreath.&nbsp; The Leyland-Tangs were Gail&rsquo;s only friends  who stopped by although the old girls sent two exceptionally large wreaths with  traditional messages of sympathy.&nbsp; Gail  stared at the characters on the ribbons around these flowers, barely  registering their meaning.&nbsp; Barbara&rsquo;s  voice, at their last get-together, filtered through her memory.&nbsp; <em>Don&rsquo;t  talk about your job anymore.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all  sick of work.&nbsp; Tell us about your son  instead, how&rsquo;s he doing at school?&nbsp;  Straight A&rsquo;s, just like you, right?&nbsp;  Such a responsible boy you&rsquo;re so lucky.</em></p>
            <p>Janie and her  father were headed towards her.&nbsp; Gail  stood up to say goodbye.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks for  coming.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janie wanted  to,&rdquo; the father said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was very fond  of him, as was I.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s eyes were  red, and, despite her father&rsquo;s prodding, she refused to look up at Gail.&nbsp; Janie clung to her father, and his hand  continually stroked her hair as he spoke.</p>
              <p>Gail did not know  them well, although she had a good impression of Janie, who was generally a  neat and well-mannered child.&nbsp; Gu Kwun  often went to Janie&rsquo;s to play, but the reverse was not the case.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that she didn&rsquo;t allow him to invite  friends over, but somehow, it never happened.&nbsp;  Her acquaintance with the father was confined to small talk when he  dropped her son off or she picked him up.&nbsp;  He was always the only parent home.&nbsp;  He was from Oregon, wrote for <em>The  Asian Wall Street Journal, </em>and Gail occasionally saw his byline &mdash; E.  Hammond &mdash; on the editorial pages which she glanced at but rarely read.&nbsp; His wife was local Chinese and ran a leading  ad agency, but Gail had never met her.</p>
              <p>He asked, &ldquo;Will  you remain in Hong Kong?&rdquo; </p>
              <p>Janie&rsquo;s father  spoke to her as a fellow American, which Gail supposed she was, although hardly  like him and his family.&nbsp; No, not like  them at all, whom Gu Kwun once called &ldquo;a real family&rdquo; which made her cross.&nbsp; She retorted <em>isn&rsquo;t our own family real?</em>&nbsp;  She told Janie&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why  yes, I guess.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Hammond studied  her through a journalist&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; No  lightweight, professionally &mdash; he was aware of her stature &mdash; but a curious  woman, difficult to befriend, who usually hurried off with barely any  conversation, as if wanting to remove Gu Kwun quickly.&nbsp; Janie once said she was afraid of Ms. Szeto,  and he told his daughter she couldn&rsquo;t possibly know her well enough to feel  that, although truthfully, he understood it.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Do you have any other family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the first time she had said it to  another person.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I can help in  any way, please call.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>They both knew  she wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
            <p>It was shortly  past noon.&nbsp; Gail thought, suddenly, of  last Thanksgiving, when she&rsquo;d managed to take a day off because New York shut  down although it was a working day in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Once Gu Kwun turned six and began attending  International, she celebrated, ordering a traditional meal from one of the  foreign caterers since she had never roasted a turkey and had no desire to  try.&nbsp; But she wanted her son to learn the  customs of his nationality.&nbsp; Now, it all  meant nothing.&nbsp; He had never even been to  America.&nbsp; Very quietly, she began to cry.</p>
              <p>The funeral  director came into the room.&nbsp; It was  time, he told her, to move on to the crematorium.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only family ride in the hearse.&nbsp; Did you want a van for the others?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><em>Where</em> was Jason?&nbsp;  She <em>had </em>told him, she knew she  had.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t something she could  possibly have forgotten to do.&nbsp; But no  one at the wake noticed his absence, not even the Leyland-Tangs, the only Hong  Kong friends of Gail&rsquo;s outside of her immediate family who had ever met Jason.</p>
                <p><em>Only family, </em>the funeral director was  saying, again, indicating the hearse and driver.</p>
              <p>All the women had  left except number one <em>A-Yi, </em>who  hovered.&nbsp; <em>Daijeih </em>was her family, she wanted to say, but hesitated, a little  afraid of Gail.&nbsp; <em>Daijeih </em>had kept all the <em>A-Yi&rsquo;s </em>away from her daughter once Gail was in her early teens.</p>
              <p>Gail glanced at <em>A-Yi&rsquo;s </em>expectant face.&nbsp; On an impulse, she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you ride with me in the hearse?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, <em>Gay-lo,&rdquo; </em>she replied, pleased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Bright afternoon  rays warmed the crematorium, outlining its stark newness.&nbsp; It had taken less than forty minutes to  arrive; the hearse sped along empty highways towards Fanling.&nbsp; The last time Gail had been out this way was  as a teenager, to buy honey from one of the apiaries.&nbsp; On the old road, it had taken an hour and a  half by bus, more than two on holidays. &nbsp;Now, the new railroad transported rapidly, and  highways eased congestion.&nbsp; Fanling was  as urban as Kowloon, no longer a place of distant graveyards and rustic  villages.</p>
            <p>The hearse parked  next to a side door where the caskets were removed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not mahogany,&rdquo; she had earlier heard number  three <em>A-Yi</em> whisper to number six as  she examined <em>Daijeih&rsquo;s</em> casket.&nbsp; Gail had refused to be sold anything more  than the basic box, just as she had opted for stone urns, not marble.&nbsp; If her mother&rsquo;s friends considered her cheap,  let them.&nbsp; Mom herself said that what  other people thought didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
            <p>Yet watching the  workers lift the boxes, first Gu Kwun&rsquo;s, and then her mother&rsquo;s, onto the  conveyor belt that would carry them into the central oven, she regretted not  honoring her mother&rsquo;s memory the way her old friends wanted.&nbsp; She could easily have rented a van and  invited all the <em>A-Yi&rsquo;s </em>along.&nbsp; The unfamiliar arrangements, though,  daunted.&nbsp; On top of everything, her watch  had vanished into thin air, leaving her temporally unbalanced.&nbsp; So she had been clumsy, unable to think  straight.&nbsp; Anyone would excuse that.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Take one last  look!&rdquo;&nbsp; the crematorium worker intoned  loudly, signaling that her mother&rsquo;s casket was ready to burn.&nbsp; <em>A-Yi</em> took her hand.&nbsp; Gail placed an arm around  the tiny, frail figure, and took a deep breath.&nbsp;  The casket disappeared into the oven. </p>
              <p>When her son&rsquo;s  casket was readied, her grip on <em>A-Yi&rsquo;s </em>hand  tightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; she whispered in  English, the language he worked to perfect.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Dream well.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, just as  the casket slid through the doors, fear surged and Gail began to sob  uncontrollably, lurching against her <em>A-Yi</em>,  clutching her arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cry, cry, it&rsquo;s  okay,&rdquo; the woman whispered, stroking her bent head like a child&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;He knew a good life, and <em>Daijeih</em> a long one.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Outside, the  bright sunshine was unmarred by haze.&nbsp;  The two women returned to the hearse.&nbsp;  It was all so quick, over in half a day, the urns of ashes to be picked  up later.&nbsp; The sky was deceptively clear,  as if the pollutants had vanished.</p>
              <p>Returning to Hunghom in the hearse, her mother&rsquo;s friend said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are my family too, <em>Gay-lo.&nbsp; </em>You can depend on  me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She meant it wholeheartedly.&nbsp; When Gail demurred, as expected, saying she  wouldn&rsquo;t trouble her unnecessarily, <em>A-Yi</em> smiled and nodded sagely, invoking her age.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Sometimes, death can be a way of finding out who we are.&nbsp; Trust me. You&rsquo;re young yet.&rdquo; Later, she declined Gail&rsquo;s offer of a lift, saying it  would be &ldquo;inconvenient.&rdquo;&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t  inconvenient at all, but she suddenly needed to be alone. </p>
            <p>Gail watched the  seventy-five year old woman walk away, this unrelated <em>chanyan,</em> who was as fit and healthy as her mother had been, her  mother who liked to say that she would live till she was a hundred.</p></td>
