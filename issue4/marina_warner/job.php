              <p>At the Turf Club, on the  verandah of Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel, in the bar at Gezira Sporting Club, in the  officers&rsquo; mess of the eleventh Hussars detailed to the garrison of Lord Cromer,  and in the offices of state where Cromer ruled as Lord Protector of Egypt, the  talk kept turning to Mr Ivor Whitaker, known as &lsquo;Young Whit&rsquo; after his late  father even though he was no longer in first youth. Young Whit was still celebrated for his  vigorous and ruddy beauty, his straight-backed horsemanship - and his  independence of thought in matters of public interest. That he was notoriously  dubbed El-Witiqui, Pasha of Sheyhk Omar, soon became clear to Rollo Verdanay,  who was newly arrived in Cairo  and had achieved his junior post in the Chancery of Lord Cromer with a sheaf of  recommendations. These included a particularly eloquent one from Whit, a family  friend, a confidante of his beautiful grandmother, and a tower of strength  throughout her childhood and youth of his equally admired mother, the intrepid  plant-hunter and botanical illustrator Amanda Verdanay.</p>

          <p>Disappointment ensued in Cairo circles when Rollo could not add much to the picture of Whit himself. As an only child of busy parents, he&rsquo;d been  sent away to school &ndash; and besides, Whit was always faraway, up to something  worthwhile and heroic, even epic. Rollo had in fact only met his benefactor  once. But he was such a familiar figure in his family&rsquo;s life he thought he knew  him and had known him all his life, and when his mother spoke of Whit, she  seemed to find what she was saying important in some way Rollo could not grasp.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
            In the city that spring, levees, luncheons,  soirees, dinners, dances, suppers, even breakfasts after supper, took place in  clubs and houses, pavilions and palaces, on a round that met head to tail since  his duties required an early start. Rollo was meeting lots of his countrymen out  in Egypt  &ndash; Lord Cromer himself acknowledged his existence:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &ldquo;A sprog of young Verdanay,  and grown already? Of course you&rsquo;ll do. And if you don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll see to it.&rdquo; This  greeting was followed by gusts of laughter, the scented breath of the great man  richly laced with port and brandy and cigars and gun oil. </p>
            <p>That was at a tea party: days  in Cairo  governing the country in partnership with the locals entailed much party-going,  Rollo began to see. It was at one of these that Major Crowhurst of the 11th  Hussars told him of his plan to liven up the social round with some more  gentlemanly pursuit than drinking tea in the afternoon. &ldquo;Cairo&rsquo;s deathly after a month or two &ndash; what?  Nothing to be done here, dear boy. Natives ostensibly in charge, so we have to  play second fiddle, dance attendance while they make a mess of things, ha, and  then come after them and put it to rights - never letting on, of course. But  this life is turning me soft! Before my time a lean and slipper&rsquo;d pantaloon!&rdquo;  He struck his belly, well-corseted in his Hussar jacket.<br>
  &ldquo;A spot of hunting, that&rsquo;s  what&rsquo;s needed,&rdquo; continued the Major.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              So it was that a few weeks later,  Major Crowhurst gave Rollo the job of fetching a special cargo newly arrived in  Alex. Rollo would have liked to take his own horse north to meet the ship when it docked,  but the cargo was to be brought later by railway to the regiment&rsquo;s compound in  the east of Cairo, and so it was decided that he would forgo the night ride  through the desert in the cool of the dark, and travel up by train himself with  his men to make sure of the preparations for the cargo&rsquo;s delivery.</p>
            <p>Air and water floated overhead  on the Nile delta in the hour before dawn and in the merciful cool, Rollo made  his way through the wharfs to the quay where the flanks of H.M S Shearwater  rose out of the swirl, like Gulliver tethered by a thousand tent pegs as the  Lilliputians swarmed over him to pick him of everything he carried. Bundles,  kegs, barrels, crates in great knotted nets swung down bulkily overhead from  the gantries and accompanied by a hullabaloo of cries dropped into the welter  of smells and sounds and colour on the docks as the <em>fellahin</em> rushed to throw them open and the quartermasters struck  their ledgers and gesticulated further directions for transporting them on the  next leg of their journey.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
              Rollo&rsquo;s Arabic now stretched  to the odd command, oath, and warning, but not to much else. He plunged into  the harum-scarum of the port, a path parting in front of him like the sea under  a sailing ship&rsquo;s prow, as his men cast to right and left with their own more  temperate cries and flourishes of their batons, and he had a rush to the head  and the sweat prickled his neck. This was the first time he had played such a  part, he, twenty-one years old, on his first detail since leaving Oxford, appointed to Lord Cromer&rsquo;s office and presently  embodying his Lordship&rsquo;s protection of Egypt. It felt something like the  explosion of pleasure all over when breaking the finishing line after a race &ndash;  hurdling had been his favourite sport, but he&rsquo;d been a champion sprinter too.</p>
            <p>He heard the fox hounds being  disembarked before he saw them; baying loudly form the openwork crate high in  the air. Neither the sea voyage nor the aerial drop quelled their energies: the  pack was a squirming mass of jaws giving voice as tongues lolled, of scrabbling  paws, and waving tails&hellip;given water and meat as soon as they landed, they were penned  in the shade by the freight train which was to leave for Cairo that night once  it was cool again, kept for a period of quarantine and then&hellip; the first fox-hunt ever  to take place in the Egyptian desert was planned for the summer.</p>
 
             <p> Rollo was a presentable and  well-behaved young man with prospects, and he found himself increasingly caught  up in the ceaseless social round: he was invited everywhere. And wherever he  went, everyone, it seemed, had an opinion or a new line to communicate to him  about his grandmother&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s friend.</p>
 
              <p>At night, as Rollo lay behind  the mosquito veiling with the servants taking turns to fan him, the gossip he  kept hearing played over and over in his head:</p>
 <p>
  - Young Whit and Lady Lucy were  out riding in the desert soon after they were first married, and near the old  city of Heliopolis  they came upon an abandoned garden &ndash; &lsquo;Sheykh Omar&rsquo;.<br>
  - There&rsquo;s a tomb of a Sufi  saint in the grounds &ndash; the place is named after him. Whit makes offerings to  him, can you beat it? <br>
  - You&rsquo;ve been there?<br>
  - Oh no, it&rsquo;s dreadfully hard  to wangle an invitation. <br>
  - They bought the property for  &pound;200 you know. &nbsp;<br>
  - Not much of a pinch for them!  She&rsquo;s rich too, you know - in her own right. <br>
  - It was first planted by the  old Khedive &ndash; Ismail &ndash; it&rsquo;s a paradise by all accounts &ndash; the Khedive used to go  there for picnics. There was no house then &ndash; if they stayed overnight they  bivouacked like nomads &ndash; under the stars.<br>
  - Witiqui Pasha and Lady Lucy  still do, given the chance.<br>
  - The old Khedive let it fall  to rack and ruin after he himself was bankrupted&hellip; he had bad habits, what?<br>
  - There were interested parties  &hellip;we wanted him in our grasp, don&rsquo;t you know? <br>
  - Whit thinks of himself as  Bedouin chief, and god, he looks the part. <br>
  - Takes their side too.<br>
  - The <em>Gyppos&rsquo;? </em><br>
  - Yes. Mind you, <em>he</em>&rsquo;d  nevercall them that &ndash; to him they&rsquo;re desert warriors and pure Arabians  of an ancient noble race. He&rsquo;s always creating about our role, saying we should  get out of the country- and give up the Canal. Doesn&rsquo;t see that Egypt matters &#8212; to us .  He&rsquo;s an &lsquo;anti-imperialist&rsquo;. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to realise that it&rsquo;ll go to blazes  without us. Or, what&rsquo;s worse, to the French.<br>
  - He breeds &rsquo;osses now. <br>
  - Yes, ten years ago he began  buying &rsquo;em at auction. The finest horseflesh in all of Arabia.  When Ali Pasha died, Whit and Lady Lucy&rsquo;s stud farm was unsurpassed &hellip; not even  King Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s could touch it.<br>
  - He breeds here now &ndash; at  Sheykh Omar &ndash; a dozen brood mares stabled there at least.&nbsp; <br>
  - The garden&rsquo;s full of wild  life, but nothing like the game back home.<br>
  - Holds with some foolishness  about harmony in nature if things are let well alone.<br>
  - There&rsquo;s a high wall all the  way around the garden <em>and</em> a whole tribe of Bedouin living there as  guards &ndash; they just camp there, desert-style, under tents &ndash; would you believe  it? <br>
  - D&rsquo;you know he turned his Arab  ruffians on some Italians who were out with their guns shooting during the  migration season. <br>
  - He&rsquo;s a law unto himself. </p>
            <p>Laughter, marvelling laughter,  harsh and bright, and much puffing on cigars and quaffing of fine wines and  liquors, punctuated these exchanges. Rollo joined in out of courtesy. Some of  it he knew, though he had not heard it told in quite the same way at home. </p>
            <p>In the withdrawing rooms where  the ladies retired, in private supper rooms, in changing rooms after golf, or tennis,  or a swim, these are some further things that were being said &ndash; more  discreetly. Rollo was privy to much of this as well, as he found many young  ladies liked to pass on what they had heard their mothers say. </p>
            <p>- Whit did build a house in the  garden to stay in.<br>
                <em>- Two </em>houses,  darling girl, one for himself as Lady L&rsquo;s husband. The other...well...<br>
  - You know what he calls it &ndash;  that other one?<br>
  - The Rose Villa &ndash; la la. Wine  and roses, don&rsquo;t you know.<br>
  - It doesn&rsquo;t end there - in  private he calls it El Hashish.<br>
  - He had it built a little  space apart from the main house because. . when he has certain guests&hellip; Lady L.  does <em>not</em> want them in the main house...<br>
  - But it comes from her, you  know, this fad for everything Oriental: she started him off. It was <em>her </em>idea  to explore the desert, and she dresses in Arab costume too, male costume &ndash; with  a dagger stuck in her belt. The pair of them, they fancy they&rsquo;re in the Arabian  Nights.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;And then the informants grew softer, even more  confiding. Clementina Crowhurst, the Major&rsquo;s daughter, imparted:</p>
            <p>- Mummy says he has more than  one family &ndash; and more than one child the one with Lady Lucy. <br>
  - Clem, honestly, her friend  Georgiana tittered.<br>
              Rollo tried to look above  tittle-tattle, but his palms sweated in anticipation.<br>
  - They say after he&rsquo;s been&hellip;  well, the mother&rsquo;s friend he waits for her daughter to grow up&hellip;<br>
              The two girls, both a little  younger than Rollo, huddled their shoulders as a peal of shivery laughter shook  them.<br>
  - You <em>know</em> him, said  Georgie, looking at Rollo and recovering her sobriety. So you&rsquo;ll get invited.<br>
  - Oh Lucky old bean, that would  be something! added Clem. Take me with you, oh do! </p>
            <p>Rollo could not understand why  it was that when he was in company, the figure of Whitiqui Pasha instantly  made his entrance,  materialising among them as if he were at that  moment streaking over the sand dunes on his Arabian mare with his wife or  another in Bedouin native dress, or presiding in his floating robes over his  Khedival pleasance, where ladies smoked and picnicked on carpets laid under the  fruit trees and jessamine arbours and wells filled purling pools and rilling  fountains, while scents and sounds mingled with the spattered light and shade.  Whit had been a figure in his family&rsquo;s conversations throughout his childhood,  but he had never struck Rollo as quite so remarkable or indeed so peculiar  before: everyone at home, especially at his grandmother&rsquo;s, took Whit for  granted and treated every inch of him with a kind of amused admiration. Here in Cairo, it was different:  underneath the hubbub of envy, curiosity and hostility, Whitaker appeared  dangerous and different and infinitely glamorous, and Rollo found himself  thinking with impatience of the garden  of Sheykh Omar and the impending  return of its <em>pasha</em> from England  in the autumn. He also rode out into the desert to find the garden; the cotton  fields running up to its high mud walls became familiar to him, but he did not  enter. </p>
            <p>A week or so later, Rollo was  riding behind the pack in the hunt Major Crowhurst had mustered. They&rsquo;d got up  before first light and were moving west under the fading stars; his dappled  mare streamed through the still pleasant cool of the early morning air. The  hounds were whirling in a dense parcel of bodies, but the whippers-in were kept  lively as they kept picking up desert scents &ndash; jackals and mongoose and a  hundred other rodents. Soon, the first heat began to finger them and they were  racing through the cotton fields, towards the wall of Sheykh Omar; there was a  stretch where it was crumbling, as Rollo knew, and he let the dogs run along  the perimeter, as the huntsmen began sounding the horns to urge them on. Soon  they were baying from open throats after the smells they picked up till the  point where the boundary wall was low enough for the hounds to jump and for  Rollo on his mare and Major Crowhurst on his stallion to follow the animals  into the enclosure of Sheykh Omar.</p>

              <p>The hounds instantly made a kill,  far too quickly. Their prey turned out to be a coyote. Then, wheeling round the  pack surged forwards on another wind; made a fresh kill again, almost  immediately. This time, it was a fox, but a small thing, like a squirrel. </p>
              Rollo remembered the talk: - They&rsquo;re pets&hellip;  his garden&rsquo;s full of animals, but nothing like our foxes back home.<br>
              As he watched the hounds at  their spoil and the huntsman flick them aside and lean down to pick up the  brush &ndash; which was not bushy, but sparse, he heard a cry of fury from behind him  and before he could turn, a blow landed on his shoulders, and then, to a  crescendo of shouts, a flurry of sticks fell on the hounds to scatter them, on  the horses of his riding companions and, to his horror, on his own mare, on her  neck and between her eyes.</p>
            <p>His blood rose in rage at this  assault on the animal, and he leaned to her neck to soothe her as she whinnied  in fright; he struck out with his crop &ndash; all the weapons he had &ndash; to right and  left, as an Arab in a none too clean <em>djellabah</em> seized his reins. But Major Crowhurst was shouting to him to head out and was  turning his own horse&rsquo;s head and ordering him to follow; but more Arabs were  running up with garden tools and poles, and the affray was joined by the others  from the hunt who came leaping over the wall to set about their assailants. 
  Eventually, in the singing heat of  midday, they made their way slowly back to Cairo, with three prisoners taken from  Whitaker&rsquo;s men.</p>
 
              <p>The repercussions of that  morning sharpened Rollo&rsquo;s misery: Whit, alerted by telegram of the hunt and the  captivity and trial of his head groom and two guards, raised the roof about the  incident. He wrote to the Foreign Office, to Lord Cromer, and to the papers. He  deplored the casual habits of the British in trespassing on the fields of hard-working  peasants, let alone entering his own animal sanctuary. But his campaign in the  public print cut deepest of all. There he expressed his surprise that more than  twenty English huntsmen, with several Hussars among them, should be so frightened  by a gaggle of barefoot <em>fellaheen</em> that they wailed of their wounds and thought it necessary to overpower them and  throw them into the cells.</p>
 
               <p>The laughter that kept rising  around Rollo before the episode now became venomous to Rollo&rsquo;s ears. He avoided  the social round as much as his post in the Chancery would allow. Then, at the  beginning of September, a <em>suffragi</em>,  in a blazing white turban and tunic and a red sash, delivered personally to him a letter  written on heavy cream paper in a spiky cursive script. </p>
               <p><em>Dear Boy,</em></p>
            <p><em>It was a damned shame  that I was gone from Sheykh Omar at the time of the unfortunate fracas. But it  is my custom to return to England  in the summer heat - as your beloved grandmother and mother will have told you.  I did not of course know that you were of the company that my men, under strict  orders in my absence to allow no trespassing, rightly drove from the garden: my  brood mares must not be disturbed, above all by any stallion in the vicinity. I  regret that the subsequent wrangles involved you and caused some difficulty  with your superiors. But it will all come out in the wash, I trust.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;In the meantime, your mother allows me at last  to meet you, to make amends for this episode which occurred through no fault of  your own. So please will you join me and my Bedouin tribe, as I call my  assembled friends at Sheykh Omar this Tuesday next, 21st September,  for an equinoctial ride at sundown and refreshments to follow - if you like to  camp under the stars as I do, we shall make you a pillow of sand for your head.  You will be very welcome. </em></p>
            <p><em>&nbsp;Your dear mother brought me to you once when  you were seven years old, the only time I have set eyes on you, when you were  playing with your little dog and rightly more interested in her than in a  foolish fond old man.</em></p>
            <p><em>&nbsp;I will rejoice to see you again &ndash; salaams and  blessings in the name of the all-merciful, Ivor W. </em><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
            Rollo Verdanay read the  letter, and re-read it. Then he sat at his desk and began his answer. But  voices kept playing in his head, and he put down his pen. Of course he longed  to accept, to go to Sheyhk Omar. But he would write to his mother first; he  needed to hear what she had to say. </p>

            <p><strong>Afterword to <em>A Family Friend</em></strong> </p>
            
            <p><em>7 July 2008</em></p>
            <p>For some time now, I have  been working towards a novel-memoir inspired by my parents&rsquo; lives in Cairo  after the war (l947-l952). I was a small baby when they moved to Egypt from  London, and my mother had never lived in England except for the few months before  and after I was born; she married my father in Southern Italy in l944 in Bari,  her home town, and did not see him again until he arrived back from India late  the following year. When they met, he was serving as a staff officer in Eighth  Army, which had advanced north and east across the Italian peninsula to deliver  Italians from the horrors that the Mussolini regime and its pact with Germany  had produced in the lives of ordinary citizens like my mother&rsquo;s family. Emilia,  always known as Ilia, was the youngest of four sisters; their mother was long  widowed, and they were all the more impoverished on account of their  respectable, bourgeois status, and as young women of their class, still needed dowries  to marry on home ground. This wasn&rsquo;t feasible, and so all four sisters were to  marry out &ndash; the elder three eventually made their way to America with Italo-American  husbands. (All this is the subject of an earlier novel of mine, <em>The  Lost Father</em>, l988.) My father, Esmond  Warner, was English, the son of a famous cricketer, and he&rsquo;d been educated at Eton and Magdalen  College, Oxford, and had served in the Coldstream guards. He offered my mother  a way out of her highly restricted life, and I think he took her to Egypt  because he thought a young southern girl would flourish there far more brightly  than in the damp, rationed, fog-bound wasteland of post-war Britain. </p>
                <p>But it was a m&eacute;salliance in many ways.  My mother made the best of things and at first, in Cairo, they were happy.  Cairo after the war was gay, very gay in the old sense of the word. My father  opened an English and French language bookshop with backing from W.H. Smith, after he had made friends with one of the directors in the army. Six years later, the shop  was burned down, on January 26 l952, the day that came to be known as Black  Saturday, when all the businesses, watering holes, and institutions owned by  British interests were sacked and destroyed. Other foreigners&rsquo; concerns also  fell victim, for example, the office supply company which Edward Said&rsquo;s father owned.  The riot was mysterious &ndash; it sprang up  apparently spontaneously, but proceeded in a very strategic and systematic way.  Its forces combined many different elements, including secular nationalists and  Islamic militants who were not usually bedfellows. Soon afterwards, King Farouk  was put aboard his luxury yacht, royally saluted by the guns of Alexandria, and  courteously seen off into exile by the new leader of the Free Officers, Gamal  Abdel Nasser. Four years later, the British suffered the d&eacute;bacle of the Suez crisis. </p>
                <p>The novel explores this fag end of British complacency and imperial power through my mother and father&rsquo;s growing  knowledge of each other. I have ambitious ideas &ndash; to pattern it on <em>The Aeneid</em> and that epic&rsquo;s treatment  of rising empires, failure in love, and  heroism, and I also want to introduce a character inspired by Franz Fanon, who  arrived in Algeria to work as a psychiatrist in l953, and who, though a  foreigner and a member of the colonial power, became more and more deeply involved in nationalist  revolution there.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There is a great deal of work still to  be done. </p>
                <p>As I was only six  when we left, I have memories, but very  little knowledge, so I have been reading through all kinds of materials about  Egypt &ndash; there is so much, and of such superb quality, that I am considering  compiling an anthology of Writings on Modern Egypt. I want to absorb the atmosphere, history,  social conditions etc so intimately that I can write my story fluently. In the  meantime, in order to tune my ear, I began practising, and A Family Friend was one of the  results &ndash; a rehearsal for the Egyptian novel.</p>
                <p>In  2007, the BBC invited me to write a short story for the actor Alan Howard to  read, as part of a week-long series celebrating his seventieth birthday. The  idea came from Julian Barnes - Alan had been seriously ill for a while and needed  cheering up. I like this Radio Four  daily slot &ndash; it&rsquo;s very good discipline to squeeze an idea into twenty minutes,  and the expressiveness of the human voice, especially a veteran actor&rsquo;s, is a  boon. </p>
                <p>The story itself is inspired by a  historical incident, which Charles Glass, the journalist and former hostage in  Beirut, told me about when I mentioned the book I am trying to write. He recommended to me a strange, small volume published  by HM Stationery Office in l999, called <em>Wilfrid  Blunt&rsquo;s Egyptian Garden/Fox-Hunting in Cairo</em>. This comes from a series that simply publishes a selection of  official reports from certain major episodes &ndash; the Profumo Affair is the focus  of another title. Later, Gill Waters, the producer of the short story for the  radio, told me that the self-effacing and brilliantly judicious editor (his  name appears nowhere in the book) is in fact Tim Coates, who&rsquo;s a well known  protestor against current trends in bookselling, and what is more, by an even  more fateful convergence, a successor of my own father as a managing director  of Sherratt &amp; Hughes in Manchester. </p>
                <p>Anyhow, after finding the Stationery Office  book, I then read a little more about Blunt in Elizabeth Longford&rsquo;s biography, <em>A Pilgrimage of Passion</em> (1979) and in Fiona MacCarthy&rsquo;s inspired book about &nbsp;William Morris, one of Blunt&rsquo;s close friends  and allies.Blunt is an astonishing and rewarding study: an English gentleman adventurer, writer,  political activist and horse-breeder; he was quixotic and in many ways  peculiar, a womaniser and a dreadful poet. He went to jail for his stand on  Irish Home rule, and in his liberationist politics as well as his amours, he  did see himself as Byron&rsquo;s successor, so much so that he married the poet&rsquo;s  grand-daughter, Lady Anne Blunt, an outstanding horsewoman and a fluent speaker  of Arabic; she brought Blunt the whole romantic and political aura of Lord  Byron &ndash; though not his literary gifts. </p>
                <p>The story takes a  great deal from Blunt and the incident when the hunt trespassed on his land outside Cairo in  l901; but I took a lot of liberties &ndash; with the freedom of fiction. I invented  Rollo &ndash; in reality, Blunt had a daughter with a young woman whose mother had also  been his lover. Something like this will  reappear in my novel, moved on fifty years &ndash; I won&rsquo;t wrench history out of  shape, as the British continued to ignore local sensitivities in ways that  Blunt had grasped long before. </p></td>
