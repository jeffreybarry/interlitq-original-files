              <p>The visiting nurse had been waiting ten minutes for her last  case of the day, a has-been priest. Her raccoon coat was folded inside out on a  chair, and she&rsquo;d placed a clean newspaper under her black bag. When she opened  the venetian blinds, hygienic winter light glazed the oilcloth and dresser  scarves of the Phoenix Hotel. How far could that Jesuit get with his halting  gait and metabolic disease? She kept her eyes peeled. If he turned up, she&rsquo;d  ask him why God made the Depression. Annie Garrahan was vehement with things  that had given her the slip.</p>

            <p>I want to help you, but first I have to hurt you, she often  warned her patients. When she&rsquo;d said this to Bernard Jolley, he told her a good  nurse was an alloy of compassion and brass. For once they agreed. A  too-sympathetic nurse was a danger. She sniffed, taking a culture of the air,  testing for evidence of liquor. Had he bothered with his insulin? No regular  priest would live in the Phoenix. Jolley was a freelance, an outcast.<br>
              <br>
 He had three  illicit passions: the river, the theater, and strong drink. Years ago, he&rsquo;d put  on church pageants, Father Jolley&rsquo;s Follies, and though the Jesuits sanctioned  theater as a means of edification, they&rsquo;d deemed him a vulgarian. And every spring,  he&rsquo;d go looking for the origin of the Hudson River in the heart of the  Adirondacks. Still, these excesses might have been tolerated if drink had not  dulled his spiritual vigilance. Drink was his great sin.<br>
 <br>As she  walked to the hotel office, young Nurse Garrahan repeated her class motto like  a prayer: <em>Esse quam videri. </em>To be  rather than to seem. Jolley was not what he seemed. He was an unpriestly  priest. Worse, he was a dreamer. Give me reality or give me death, she thought,  as she knocked on Sam Livingston&rsquo;s solid oak door. </p>
  <br>
  <br>
            <p>Like daylight and science, Sam Livingston&rsquo;s purpose was to  make the world so ordinary that people could bear to live in it. Nurse Garrahan  told him she could fix the best menu for atonic constipation he ever tasted.  &ldquo;It hits the spot,&rdquo; she said.<br>
 <br> She was  tired of chasing Bernard Jolley through the bitter streets of Troy, New York.  She thought Jolley needed a dog &mdash; something adoring to follow him around and  press its cold black nose into his knee as he held forth. He wasn&rsquo;t satisfied  unless he was tearing the heart out of the obvious. Just thinking of his  longwindedness made her woozy.<br>
 <br> &ldquo;Cocamilk&rsquo;s  best for an upset stomach.&rdquo; Sam opened a miniature Frigidaire and produced two  bottles. &ldquo;My housekeeper, Mrs. Fredrickson, won a contest with this. First  prize for most nourishing soft drink. Say when,&rdquo; and he poured milk into a half  glass of cola. Annie took a sip.&nbsp; <br>
  <br> &ldquo;Tastes  swell!&rdquo;<br>
  <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of adding it to The  Ship&rsquo;s menu,&rdquo; Sam said somberly. In addition to the Phoenix Hotel, he owned a  floating dance pavilion. &ldquo;Something special, to outclass the competition.&rdquo;<br>
 <br> &ldquo;The weather  and disease are my competition,&rdquo; Annie said. &ldquo;And now this hobo priest. &rdquo; <br>
 <br> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s  Jolley&rsquo;s problem, anyhow?&rdquo; <br>
 <br> Annie  appreciated Sam&rsquo;s direct and simple speech, the way he referred to the Phoenix  Hotel as The Place and the Ship of Joy as The Ship. He was sensible, yet his  blue eyes always looked mildly surprised. There was a sweet yet manly scent  about him, a blend of cigarettes and menthol, Barbasol and talcum. &ldquo;Sugar.&rdquo; She  added reluctantly, &ldquo;And the DTs.&rdquo;<br>
 <br> Sam shook  his head. He was thirty-nine, a man of the world. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo; His heavy key ring  jingled with industry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you The Place and give you the best shoeshine  you ever had. You&rsquo;re only as young as your feet, you know.&rdquo; <br>
 <br> As they  walked the hallways, Annie was soothed by their no-skid rubber tiles. She took  comfort in the stark usefulness of the restaurant&rsquo;s napkin dispensers, the  chrome toothpick holders and hefty china cups. When they entered Sam&rsquo;s hotel  flat, a transfusion of well-being surged through her, and she almost cried for  cheerfulness. The carpet roiled with ferny ferns, the wallpaper was big with  orchids, the drapes with jungle gardenias. These were heavyweight flowers,  flowers with muscles. They bulged and flexed and leapt from the walls, larger  than life. <br>
 <br> She planted  herself on the chintz sofa in glad anticipation while Sam fetched his shoeshine  kit. Kneeling at her feet, he began to swab and brush her pumps. First he  polished, using an old toothbrush on the tight spots; then he waterproofed with  an emollient he&rsquo;d crafted himself from pine sap, mink oil, and beeswax. He  roughed the soles with sandpaper, buffed the leather with his bare hands, and  sat back on his heels. You&rsquo;re in business, he declared. <br>
 <br> &ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;  Annie crowed. She felt reborn.<br>
 <br> As Sam was  putting away his polishes, she glimpsed a collection of cure-alls in the  cupboard. These remedies testified to a secret delicacy in him, and her nursely  vocation flared like a flame. At first her family might not approve of a  divorced former bootlegger, fourteen years her senior. They wouldn&rsquo;t like the  rumors of fifty-gallon copper kettles in a frame barn on 113th Street, the  aliases he was said to assume, the bullet scar on his left arm, the fact that  he was a Protestant. But they&rsquo;d come around. Sam was her chance. As a  registered nurse, she had what he needed. Here was someone she could save, an  opportunity to use her training. She clicked her heels and clenched her hands,  inspired, in fact, thrilled to the bone. <br>
 <br> But her  immediate problem was Bernard Jolley. She told Sam she feared the priest had  gone off on a spree. Delirium tremens usually followed a hard debauch, and she  wanted to start treatment before hallucinations or wet brain developed. He&rsquo;ll  be fit to be tied, Nurse Garrahan predicted.<br>
 <br> &ldquo;We might  try a restraining sheet fastened to the headboard in a simple clove hitch,&rdquo; Sam  said, &ldquo;though a mattress on the floor is safest. What&rsquo;d they say in nursing  school?&rdquo;<br>
 <br> Annie rolled  her eyes and waved her hand to push the thought away. She couldn&rsquo;t give a  priest a prolonged warm tub bath, let alone perform high colonic irrigations of  normal saline.<br>
 <br> Sam lit a  cigarette, and Annie noticed the signet ring, yellow gold with a diamond, on his  little finger. Diamond was the hardest stone, and gold never tarnished. As she  stared at the ring, she remembered an article in her nursing journal on radium  treatment. Radium looked like salt, but it was rare and costly. It was kept  inside a lead-lined safe, whose combination was guarded by the radium  custodian, a graduated nurse, paid to keep track of every gram since all the  radium in the world would fill only a pint bottle, and radium took nineteen  thousand years to decompose to lead.<br>
 <br> Nineteen  thousand years! Why should radium last that long? Or diamonds, or gold? Why  were they almost perpetual while people were fragile, gone in a flash? When Sam  died, someone would twist the ring from his finger, and the ring would  continue, but Sam would be gone forever. There was heaven, oh yes. But objects  inherited the earth. It was so unfair, it made her mad. She glanced at her  watch, seeking reassurance.<br>
 <br> As she was  resisting these abnormal thoughts, Annie became aware of a calming aroma, the  fragrance of bakery blended with rose water. She sensed an approaching  gentleness and was looking toward the open door when a motherly face peered in.<br>
 <br> It was Sam&rsquo;s  housekeeper, Mrs. Gertrude Fredrickson. Call me Freddy, she said. On her left  breast, over her heart, Annie noticed an unusual brooch: a tiny snapshot of a  boy encased in glass and framed in gold. Freddy was carrying a tray. &ldquo;I made a  pineapple pie, and it&rsquo;ll taste even better if I share it,&rdquo; she said. While the  housekeeper was in the kitchen, Sam confided that Mrs. Fredrickson must have  been a Girl Scout troop leader at one time because she was always inviting him  to do beadwork or tool leather with her after hours.<br>
 <br> Freddy&rsquo;s  eyelashes fluttered helplessly as she handed Sam his plate. Why, she&rsquo;s  lovesick, Annie thought, with a twinge of sympathy. The housekeeper told them  Bernard Jolley&rsquo;s bed hadn&rsquo;t been disturbed all week. &ldquo;Are you the hotel nurse?&rdquo;  she asked, and Annie smiled and denied it.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
            <p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what she became. There was a great need  for nursing at the Phoenix Hotel, and Annie was there every day on her lunch  hour, looking for Father Jolley. She&rsquo;d reported him missing, but she still  thought he&rsquo;d turn up. Meanwhile, the other ailing residents required Ovaltine  for sleeplessness, Mazon soap for ringworm, Petrolagar for constipation. When  Annie learned of Sam&rsquo;s stomach ulcer, she arrived with bowls of junket and  sparkling gelatins known to aid the healing of inflamed mucosa. Soon the  tenants were lining up outside Sam&rsquo;s office, waiting for Nurse Garrahan to  appear in her navy dress with detachable white collar and cuffs.<br>
 <br> One day, a  short bristling woman cut through the line, rushed pell-mell past Annie, seized  an open bottle of pills and hurled the contents at the assembled tenants.  Annie&rsquo;s protest faded when she recognized the hooligan as the supervisor of  visiting nurses, Victorine Crawley.<br>
 <br> She&rsquo;d heard  Nurse Crawley lived in a hotel, but she&rsquo;d never dreamed it was the Phoenix.  They&rsquo;d been in training together, and after graduation, Victorine Crawley had  advanced quickly in the profession. Annie glimpsed the silver whistle, used to  summon staff, around her neck. <em>She&rsquo;s  always there when she needs you. </em>That caption, said to be a printer&rsquo;s  error, had appeared under her yearbook photo. Her ears were cunningly made and  adorned with earrings shaped like Florence Nightingale lamps. These earrings  were rumored to be lockets filled with an unidentified white substance. Annie  admired them.<br>
 <br> &ldquo;Do you  think you&rsquo;re being a good nurse?&rdquo; Victorine Crawley demanded. This&rdquo; &mdash;she  brandished the empty bottle &mdash; &ldquo;is how you&rsquo;re treating your employers. You&rsquo;re  throwing medicine at these people! Can I be more expressive?&rdquo; With that, she  hustled off to rap knuckles and reprimand inferiors elsewhere in her district.  She won&rsquo;t be happy till everyone&rsquo;s as miserable as she is, a tenant quipped.  But Annie was too disturbed by the charges to laugh. A good nurse was all she  wanted to be.<br>
 <br> <em>To be rather than to seem. </em>A good nurse  defended the real and true against the half-baked or mysterious. She raised  resistance against disorders that made the normal seem awful. Raising  resistance was Annie&rsquo;s vocation. She did it mostly by talking. When she was in  training, the other probationers would gather outside her door, suppressing  giggles as they listened to her solitary murmurs: <em>Clara Barton. Glamour, coffee enemas.</em> Though they&rsquo;d teased, the  others had to admit her monologues could rouse the dead. They&rsquo;d witnessed as  she leaned over the comatose, urging them to rise and shine, talking until  their lips quivered and their pinpoint pupils dilated, until their color  improved and they demanded steamed clams with butter sauce and crackers.<br>
 <br> When  Victorine Crawley got wind of this gift, she&rsquo;d nabbed Annie in the hall. I am  dismayed, she said, by your yen for self-glory. The same meaning lurked beneath  today&rsquo;s accusation: You think you&rsquo;re special, don&rsquo;t you, starting a clinic in  the hotel where I live, on my stomping ground. Annie could imagine the report  she&rsquo;d file: Nurse Garrahan must curb her tendency to freelance and assume a  doctor&rsquo;s role&hellip;.<br>
 <br> The pills  tossed by Victorine Crawley struck Mrs. Fredrickson&rsquo;s seven-year-old son,  Eugene, and his whippet, Moonshine. Annie recognized the boy from Freddy&rsquo;s  brooch and Sam&rsquo;s descriptions. He&rsquo;d been waiting to get cough medicine for his  mother. Eugene&rsquo;s father had died, but the housekeeper saw that her boy had  nicer clothes than most: the toes of his shoes had not been cut out to make  room for growth; the moth holes in his sweater were small. His wren-brown hair appeared  gray as his mother&rsquo;s, and his horn-rimmed glasses were so similar he might have  inherited them, too. His whippet, a racing dog abandoned by a former tenant,  was wind-broken and high-strung. Eugene had built a model of Sam&rsquo;s floating  dance pavilion, the Ship of Joy, and he often stopped there on his way home  from school. The two of them would lean over the railing to dip their hands in  the frigid Hudson, Sam&rsquo;s superstitious ritual. He took the boy to prizefights  to make him more rugged, and when they passed in the hall, he&rsquo;d softly punch  him and say how&rsquo;s the boss. </p> 
 <br>
 <br>
            <p>For two weeks, Annie tried to imagine where Bernard Jolley  might have gone. Thinking like a Jesuit was a terrible effort. At last, Sam  suggested they set out in his Cadillac to look for Jolley at his usual haunts.  Soon they were drifting past brick storefronts and two-families, heading for  the smudge of trees along the Hudson River.<br>
 <br> &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s  melting.&rdquo; Sam let out the clutch. <br>
 <br> &ldquo;The river&rsquo;s  awful high.&rdquo; <br>
 <br> They  squinted at the Hudson, a tidal estuary composed of power laundry and textile  runoff, bleaching and dyeing agents, milk products, paper, and unclassified  wastes. Annie frowned. Jolley had infected her with this knowledge. Thanks to  him, she&rsquo;d never spend a night on the river without thinking of American eels  ruffling the moonlit surface, gulping oxygen through the nares in their snouts.  She gave her nurse&rsquo;s bag a little kick. Eels fed on carrion and breathed  through their skins. Their sense of smell was good as a dog&rsquo;s, and they could  travel overland when conditions were wet. She pressed the lock on her door and  peered through the mist. Silver lampreys covered with mucus lived in the toxic  depths. Boneless, jawless parasites with rasp-like teeth that burrowed through  a host&rsquo;s skin to feed on blood and tissue. But lampreys were rare. That was the  nice thing about them. That set your mind at rest. Now northern water snakes &hellip;<br>
 <br> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know how a lame priest can dance,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Did you ever see Jolley dance?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>&ldquo;I told him, if you want to be the Dancing  Priest, you have to be more social.&rdquo; She scanned the shirt workers and school-kids  at the bus stop. &ldquo;I hope he hasn&rsquo;t gone on one of his pilgrimages in this  miserable weather.&rdquo;<br>
 <br> Given a  chance, Jolley said he would climb Mount Marcy, the highest peak in the Empire  State. He would follow Calamity Brook, then trail the Opalescent River till it  became Lake Tear of the Clouds, the splash of blue that was the Hudson&rsquo;s  rumored source. She checked her nurse&rsquo;s bag for the small bottle of insulin. If  acidosis had set in, she could revive him hypodermically.<br>
 <br> As they  turned onto 109th Street, the fog parted and they had a clear view of the Ship  of Joy. On the hurricane deck, near the smokestack, a figure lorded it over the  river. As they got closer, Annie saw its outstretched arms were formed from an  oar, its backbone from a mop pole. Its swab of hair was haloed by a dented  hubcap and fishing nets strung with bottle openers jangled from its  extremities. It was swathed in a long black frock. <br>
 <br> &ldquo;To scare  the gulls,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;You lose business if people slip on bird do or a rat  runs up somebody&rsquo;s leg. The Ship is the only dance garden with a scarecrow. You  have to consider the competition. The Blue Heaven gets big names &mdash; Sammy Kaye&rsquo;s  Orchestra, Cab Calloway. I get Horton Spur, the Boy Who Bounces, and Margie  Barrett, the Fiddling Tap Dancer. &rdquo;<br>
 <br> &ldquo;You could  put out some traps.&rdquo; <br>
 <br> &ldquo;The  scarecrow&rsquo;s unique. It&rsquo;s a mascot, a good-luck charm.&rdquo;<br>
 <br> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  dressed better than some of your clientele.&rdquo;<br>
 <br> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no  cover, that&rsquo;s why. Like the ads say, Exclusive &mdash; not expensive.&rdquo; <br>
 <br> Annie  smiled. If Sam wanted the Ship of Joy to be exclusive, he shouldn&rsquo;t have  started the soup kitchen on Mondays, when the dance pavilion was closed for  business. He shouldn&rsquo;t let the destitute lounge on the deck chairs in nice  weather. He was chronically kindhearted, that was the problem. It posed a  danger for her. How could she advance in her profession if she spent her spare  time helping him buy storm windows for his old people at the Phoenix or new  shoes for his sister with the expensive foot? How could she save him when he  was busy saving other people?<br>
 <br> &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo;  Sam continued. &ldquo;The Blue Heaven is too dark. What are they trying to hide with  that candlelight? A dirty kitchen. Could be bugs. I like to see what I&rsquo;m  eating. That&rsquo;s what I like about you, Annie. You put your cards on the table.&rdquo; <br>
 <br> &ldquo;I thought  you liked the way I smell like Ivory soap.&rdquo;<br>
 <br> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right. And I like nurses. I like the way they kiss with their eyes open.&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s  smile was both debonair and shy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try the Oakwood,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Jolley  goes there to visit with God.&rdquo;</p>
 <br> <br>
              <p>Five minutes later, the Cadillac swooped through the iron  gates, past the ornate crematorium of the Oakwood Cemetery. Once they were  inside, Sam pulled over. He fished out his pocket compass and studied the  red-tipped needle floating under glass. Annie, meanwhile, had come upon her new  lipstick in her bag. She swabbed at her mouth and felt the oxygen promise of  vermilion &mdash; the color of transfusions, high blood counts, nourishing hemoglobin  &mdash; restore her smile. She approved of things in mint condition. Her taste ran to  sanitary, progressive angles that did not gather dust.</p>
 <p>That was the  problem with the Oakwood; it wasn&rsquo;t modernistic. It was a vast puzzle of  unnamed gravel roads winding through evergreens and bony birches and hills that  rose to hide whatever tipsy cross you&rsquo;d chosen as a landmark. They drove past  sooty slabs and headstones, ghost-weights that kept the passed-away from  spinning in their graves till time had time to soothe their rest. Annie saw the  lamb sweet as glucose at the good shepherd&rsquo;s feet, and twin angels kneeling in  the muck, their wings fibrillating through the mist. It was the mud she  disliked most. That mud could ruin a new pair of pumps. She peered at marble  houses with barred windows, padlocked doors, and tiny yards tucked into iron  fences. The Oakwood was a good place to catch your death of dampness, when all  was said and done. An ashen-skinned angel flew by in its granite nightgown, its  eyes downcast, its arm pointing upwards through the fog. </p>
 <p>Sam stopped  the car alongside an ancient family vault, and they got out to have a smoke.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall in any open graves,&rdquo; he called. But Annie was already standing  beside him in the headlights, puffing without inhaling from her Old Gold.</p>
 <p> Sam  Livingston bought graves the way other men bought neckties, and he liked to  advise young Nurse Garrahan on the pros and cons of available lots. It seemed  the sections with the best views had no breathing room. They were crowded, hard  to mow, or close to traffic, while the spacious sites were located under messy  shade trees or afflicted with poor drainage. In fact, no grave had won his  perfect confidence. Yet Annie did not understand his wish to be buried above  ground, in a mausoleum full of fungus and powdery mildew. Sam could imagine  tree-of-heaven plants, unkillable weeds that hatched in crevices, uprooted  stones, and grew eight feet overnight. He could imagine being buried alive, the  satin suffocation of a casket. What he could not imagine was the end of all  imagining. She dropped her cigarette and ground it underfoot.</p>
 <p> &ldquo;Friends,  some things are best disposed of by burning.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> They spun  around to see Bernard Jolley materialize from a cloud of exhaust. His black  vestments were absorbed by darkness, but his face flared forth &mdash; a sallow,  phosphorescent structure with too many bones. The sweaty smell of sanctity hung  around him, and his eyes were gray as griddles.</p>
 <p> &ldquo;Holy  smoke,&rdquo; Annie said. </p>
 <p> Father  Jolley was middle-aged, but he seemed timeless. His glass eye made his sunken  glance more steadfast &mdash; he looked as if he were always ready to cry &ldquo;behold!&rdquo;  When he talked, his lips squirmed and seemed unconnected to the rest of his  face, which stayed inexpressive as a fish. Really, the intensity of his calm  irritated Annie. She felt if she stuck her tongue out at him, he&rsquo;d place a  communion wafer on it.</p>
 <p> She searched  her bag and handed him the baked sweet potato she&rsquo;d packed that morning. The  cheerful yam was well tolerated by diabetics, if properly masticated.</p>
 <p> Jolley said,  &ldquo;Nurse Garrahan, you are a brick. I hope I may prevail upon you to star in my  next production.&rdquo; </p>
 <p> Some vain  and spangled part of Annie liked the sound of this. She was secretly amazed that  she was not already in the limelight, making curtsies so deep her permanent  wave brushed the crowns of the crowned heads who were her public. </p>
 <p> &ldquo;<em>The Nightingales of Troy</em>. A water ballet, combining medical  and aesthetic values, to be performed in the Hudson River.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> &ldquo;I never saw  a nightingale in Troy,&rdquo; Annie said. &ldquo;But then, I&rsquo;m from Watervliet.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> &ldquo;I never saw  one in Lansingburgh,&rdquo; Sam added.</p>
 <p> Jolley  limped into the white specter of a headlight and waved his sweet potato at the  heavens. Blessed are they who do not see but believe, he said, and Annie was  afraid he would start chattering in Latin or launch into a litany of dictionary  words and foreign phrases, an utterance with every hair in place that wound on  and on in longwinded loops of book-learned pronouncements until she lost her  bearings and wanted to strike a hear-no-evil stance with her hands over her  ears. </p>
 <p> Not the  songbird, Jolley said, clasping the sweet potato to his breast. Florence Nightingales. A  show that dramatizes the importance of home nursing care to the housebound  invalids of Troy.  And he stroked and punched the dark to make them see the synchronized Rockette  kicks of swimmers in Red Cross bathing caps and the flailing limbs of those  going down for the third time while the bell tolled on Sam&rsquo;s ship, the Ship of  Joy. He was all gray matter and hot air, he was dirty but luminous, holding the  tuber aloft like a torch. Why, he&rsquo;s burning up, Nurse Garrahan thought. And  when he finished, his silence was momentous, as if he expected them to say,  Father, you have told us things we&rsquo;ve wanted to know for a hundred years, and  now our lives will never be the same.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Bernard, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask you,&rdquo; Sam  said. &ldquo;How did you come by the nickname of the Dancing Priest?&rdquo;</p>
 <p> Jolley  sniffed the sweet potato absentmindedly. Then he put it in his pocket. &ldquo;How can  we know the dancer from the dance?&rdquo; </p>
 <p> &ldquo;And another  thing,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Can the river get sore and hold a grudge?&rdquo;</p>
 <p> &ldquo;Ancient  customs of propitiation arose from such convictions.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> Annie  cleared her throat. </p>
 <p> &ldquo;Burning was  the preferred method of sacrifice. The Druids placed their victims in willow  cages, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> She started  humming &ldquo;Moonlight Bay.&rdquo; </p>
 <p> &ldquo;Do you  think the river minds the speedboat rides I sell in good weather?&rdquo; Sam asked. </p>
 <p> &ldquo;It was not  always thus. There was a time when a person who longed for absolute peace and  quiet could find it by going on a river trip.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> Sam said, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mind the upkeep. Shoveling snow off the roof or flushing toilets all  night to keep the pipes from freezing. It&rsquo;s the ice floes, the floods.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> &ldquo;The river  has been injured. It was not always thus.&rdquo; </p>
 <p> &nbsp;Those swimming ballerinas should be greased up  with a good coat of lard, Annie thought, before they took the plunge. </p>
 <p>&ldquo;My housekeeper was born with the caul and has  second sight. She told me there&rsquo;s a jinx on The Ship. Do you know how to remove  a jinx, Bernard? Can you tone it down some way?&rdquo; </p>
 <p>&ldquo;There are rites. The<em> Ritual Romanus.</em> I could drop salt into water so as to form a  cross&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
 <p>&ldquo;Then I got a business proposition. I&rsquo;d like  to hire you to take the spell off The Ship.&rdquo; </p>
 <p>&ldquo;I could,&rdquo; Jolley raised his right hand,  &ldquo;utter the words &lsquo;Get thee gone, vanquished and cowed, when thou art bidden in  the name of the Lord &mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
 <p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the  ticket,&rdquo; said Sam. </p>
 <p>&ldquo;And when the malignant spirit has fled, I  could pour the holy water in the river.&rdquo; </p>
 <p> &ldquo;I need a  specimen, Father,&rdquo; Annie said. &ldquo;Are you experiencing unusual thirst or intense  itching? Any tingling of the toes and fingers?&rdquo;</p>
 <p> &ldquo;Nurse  Garrahan, you are an object lesson.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the potato, Father?&rdquo; she continued.  &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the ballet?&rdquo; The Nightingales of Troy would develop new and terrible  diseases after their dip. There would be no toxoid available. It sounded  educational. </p>
 <p> &ldquo;The potato  is a first-class feast, which I will save for a time of need. I am on retreat.  The saints will provide spiritual essence to drink and consecrated energy to  eat. Then, if God allows, I may sanctify the river&rsquo;s depths with reserves of  spiritual power that can be invoked for the benefit of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
 <p> Sam nodded  and Annie shook her head. She thought the depths should be left alone. The  surface was as it should be, that&rsquo;s why it had become the surface. She approved  of dissections when the scalpel stuck to reality. But the hocus-pocus of hidden  meanings earned her scorn &mdash; the purpose of science was to stamp out that mumbo  jumbo. Instead of saying the rosary before she went to sleep, Annie would list  the structures through which fat passed on its route from the intestine to the  cardiac chamber, beginning with the tiniest villi, wending through the lacteal  and larger lymphatic vessel, rising toward the thoracic duct and left  innominate vein to permeate the superior vena cava and enter the red springs of  the heart.</p></td>
