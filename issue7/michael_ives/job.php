            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Little  more than a year after a boy had determined that he and his sister and mother  had walked out of a picture book about an excursion to the raspberry patch and  into their present situation, an older man took to loitering around the stone  stairs which led from the lower to the upper terrace of their yard.  From inside the house they watched as the man  walked back and forth along the sidewalk or stood farther away at the foot of  the driveway with his hands clasped behind his back.  Occasionally he would even begin to ascend a  few of the steps and stand and look toward the house as if he were deciding  whether to come to the door or not.  When  occasionally he offered a greeting to the boy&rsquo;s mother or sister, both would  reply coolly and continue up the granite steps.   The mother assumed he was motivated by a weird, ineffectual form of  lechery, and she and the sister would often wait several hours until the man  was gone before venturing outside again.   Only the boy suspected that the raspberry patch &ndash; after their departure  from it into the house they presently occupied &ndash; had assumed the form of this  man and was watching them through his eyes, and that this man served as a navel  or sole item of evidence that they had come from another place, even if most of  the time they felt as though they had always been here in this world.  A television program in which a little girl  fell from her bed into another dimension of time and space only fortified the boy&rsquo;s  notion.  Without a clear idea as to what  such a dimension could be, he spent hours at a time searching every floor of the  house, tapping the walls to see if his fingers would penetrate through to that  other place.  In the attic, where the roof  trusses ran into an impenetrable darkness at the eaves, he discovered among  some old magazines between two joists a cache of bass violin bridges.  Though he turned them over and over in his  hands and held one of them up to his face, he could not deduce their function,  nor did they reveal their purpose when later, down in the cellar among old  armoires fronted with panels of indecipherable marquetry and stairways  terminating at doors that no longer opened, he ventured without conscious plan  to nail the bridges in a row to a length of old leather.  That his eyes, when he put the contrivance over  his head, should align perfectly with the two lobes at either side of one of  the bridges elicited a familiar, muted shame, for he assumed it wrong to take  pleasure in such frivolous symmetries.  </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">With  slow, uncertain movements, as he toured the lawns, half-blind, the device teetering on his head like a lampshade,  first holly leaves, then azalea leaves, then a corner of the house, passed  across his sight fleetingly, as if they moved and he remained stationary.  Near the stone stairs, he ducked in under the  whip-like stays of a forsythia, where patches of sunlight fell across his legs  in quick diagrams of lozenges and chevrons.   At the very edge of his vision, he could see, across the carriage path,  in a neighbor&rsquo;s myrtle, a large stray dog urinating under the sweetgum.  A few degrees further right and there  appeared, just inches from his elbow, buried in tall grass and grapevine, an  ancient sandstone lion recumbent on a plinth. Its features were so worn away as to render  the couchant form of the beast nearly indecipherable.  In the midst of these contemplations a large  stag beetle ascended the rubber semicircle at the toe of his sneaker.  He shook his leg in terror and scrambled out  from under the bush, one hand steadying the mask on his head.  </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:14.15pt;">&ldquo;Well  hell&rsquo;s bells &ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Someone was suddenly quite  near him.  &ldquo;&ndash; an old harlot&rsquo;s cage!&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy yanked the mask from his head to find  the old man sitting on the stairs.  &ldquo;Saw  one once in some<em> booth</em> or other,&rdquo; he  said.  &ldquo;Yes sir, must cover the faces of those <em>naughty </em>girls.&rdquo; The broad plaid in his shirt seemed to pulsate  in concert with his peculiar and arbitrary emphasis of certain words.  &ldquo; &hellip; them, I mean, who <em>dishallow </em>their marriage vows.&rdquo;&nbsp;  The dog had at this point crossed over the carriage path and now sniffed  at the man&rsquo;s pant leg. &ldquo;Little <em>mechanism </em>over here &ndash;&rdquo; he pointed to the  side of the animal&rsquo;s head in a demonstration that appeared impossibly  spontaneous, &ldquo; &ndash; tightened the works according to the pleasure of the offended  husband.&rdquo; He then mimed with one hand  the turning of a key while the other tightened around an imaginary skull.  The boy felt an uncomfortable pressure build in  his bladder.  &ldquo;Um &hellip; hi, I live up there,&rdquo;  he said, hoping that just to point toward the house might, this one time,  transport him inside it.  &ldquo;Today we have  such as <em>governments</em> &ndash;&rdquo; continued the  man in utter disregard, his tone suddenly scornful, &ldquo;&ndash; to put an end to these  venerable forms of justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">The  dog, by all appearances under the power of the man&rsquo;s remote allusions, lay down  on the sidewalk.  Its glazed, erect penis  lolled half out of its sheath.  &ldquo;No meaningful  recourse anymore,&rdquo; the man went on as though a crowd had gathered, &ldquo;just  blackmail and voodoo dolls.  Hear what  I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s discomfort  bordered on panic, but all the same he felt obliged to say something out of  politeness.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &hellip; um &hellip; <em>voodoo </em>doll?&rdquo; he finally stammered.  &ldquo;Not aware of much, are you, Petunia?&rdquo; the old  man replied contemptuously.  Against the  sun and drilling chirr of cicadas, the  dog&rsquo;s eye half closed.  Its lazy priapism,  while the man stared off into space, slowly sawed back and forth in the stiff,  new mown grass.  Oh, if only he could  stop looking at it, the boy thought to himself in the excruciating silence. The old man at last, rose from the stairs to  leave but then paused before the trunk of a honey locust. &ldquo;Well now, what son  worth his salt,&rdquo; he said, breaking off one of its spikes, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t want to make  his mama scream for the hell of it? Action  at a distance, you read?&rdquo; He extended his  hand and once more approached.  &ldquo;Put &lsquo;er  there,&rdquo; he said, and the boy without thinking took hold of it.  So gingerly did the man then prick him with  the thorn that, though he felt nothing, a tiny bulb of blood rose up on the  heel of his thumb. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t tell your  mother,&rdquo; the man warned him.  He placed  the thorn in the boy&rsquo;s palm. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a  machine at home that&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder from beyond the  carriage path, &ldquo;and if you do, it&rsquo;ll turn your blood to stone.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
          <p  style="text-indent:14.15pt;">And  though it grow, still the droplet held, red and round on the boy&rsquo;s hand &ndash; a fruit  breaking through to an inaudible summons.   And the raspberry patch fell away.   Or the boy.  No matter.  &ldquo;I am the word of life,&rdquo; it cried to him and  it slipped away. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is the life  itself,&rdquo; said the breaking drop.  </p>           </td>
