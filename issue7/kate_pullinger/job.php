              <p><strong><em>The Mistress  of Nothing</em></strong><em>,  a novel, is set in Egypt in the 1860s.  It is based on the true story of Lady Duff Gordon and her lady&rsquo;s maid,  Sally Naldrett. Stricken with  consumption, Lucie Duff Gordon was given a stark choice:&nbsp; exile in a dry climate or an early death in  the damp English climate. Lucie chose  to travel to Egypt, accompanied only by Sally, her maid; they took up residence  in Luxor where they were, for much of the time, the only Europeans. This extract is from chapter five, about one  quarter of the way into the story. </em></p>

            <br>            Ramadan arrived, the holy  month of fasting from dawn till dusk.  All activity in the French House slowed to a snail&rsquo;s pace in the daytime  as no one had the energy to do much of anything, except me, and I found I could  think of nothing but food all day, even though I was not fasting. Mr Abu Halaweh continued to cook for us,  which both my Lady and I thought was beyond the call of duty, but he wouldn&rsquo;t  have it any other way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; he  said to me one morning when I tried to relieve him, &lsquo;you might poison her with  your food.&rsquo; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Omar!&rsquo; I  shouted, and I attempted to swot him with my spoon but he ducked down low and  got away. Then I realised I had used his  Christian name, not his Christian name of course, but his given name, and said,  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Mr Abu Halaweh,&rsquo; I bowed my head and placed my palms together  the way he did when he was showing respect and wished I had a veil to draw  across my face. In Esher  there were always a few servants with whom I never progressed beyond formal  address;&nbsp; Sir Alick had a butler  everyone, including Sir Alick, called Mr Roberts, even after he had been in the  household for more than a decade. There  were others with whom I used first names straight away, and others still who didn&rsquo;t  really have names but were known by their position, like Cook, of course. But  as soon as I&rsquo;d said it, Omar felt right to me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  shrugged. &lsquo;This is my name. You may use it, I&rsquo;m happy.&rsquo; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Please,&rsquo; I  said, &lsquo;you must call me Sally.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of  course I blushed, and I paused for a moment at the thought of impropriety, but  I shook this off quickly. Our complicity  had deepened and, after we began to use our first names, it was hard to believe  we&rsquo;d ever done anything differently. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ramadan  continued, visitors to my Lady&rsquo;s afternoon salon dropped away, and Saleem  Effendi and Mustafa Agha sent gifts of incense and scented soap by way of  apology. Luxor  was very quiet. At sunset Omar was able  to break his fast; he would have laid a small plate of dates &nbsp;and a glass of water for himself earlier, in  anticipation. While my Lady was unable  to persuade Omar to join us among the cushions during our afternoon reading  session, during Ramadan he did consent to share the evening meal with us, such  was the sense of occasion. We took to  eating together in the salon as the sky over the Theban hills went from deep  and starry blue to black. I would carry  in a basin of water, soap, and napkin for my Lady to wash her hands -  cleanliness is highly valued in Egypt,  so much so that I&rsquo;ve begun to think we English must appear rather grubby when  we travel in this country &ndash; then I prepared basins for myself and Omar as  well. I lit the many candles while Omar  brought the food into the salon on a large silver tray that he set upon a low  stool, and we three sat on cushions around it.  We had both become accustomed to eating in the Egyptian manner, using  the right hand only to scoop up the rice and beans with the delicious herbed  and salted bread that he makes. We drank  lemonade and tea and toasted each other and all our best qualities. My Lady told jokes and, more often than not,  we&rsquo;d have to explain the punchline to Omar which would prove even more  amusing. We&rsquo;d laugh and shout and every  once in a while I&rsquo;d allow my Lady to persuade me to do my impression of the  dancing girl <em>houri </em>whose performance  we had witnessed in Edfu. I don&rsquo;t know  why or how this had become my party trick, but it had. Dancing for an audience, however small and  familiar:&nbsp; no one in all of England  would have believed me to be capable of such a thing. And the most peculiar thing was, I enjoyed  it. I enjoyed it enormously.&nbsp; It was a very bad impression, I was clumsy  and slow on my feet, but it never failed to make us all roar. My Lady and Omar reclined on their cushions  and they applauded me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;d grown so  relaxed and familiar with each other; I see now that this was extraordinary,  that the shifts and changes in our relationships to one another were, for all  three of us, unprecedented. My Lady had  always treated her staff well, but now we&rsquo;d moved beyond any of the formalities  left between employer and employee. Omar  had stuck to the old structures for longer than me, but it was as though the  devotion required during Ramadan had produced in him a license, a new sense of  freedom. To me, it was all part of the  surreal beauty of life in Egypt. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During  Ramadan I expected Omar&rsquo;s appetite to be enormous, but in fact, as the days  went by he seemed to eat less and less, and like everyone else in the village,  approached life with increasing languor.  My Lady took ill, which was hard for us to bear given how well she had  been feeling. Not the usual coughing and  spitting, but something else, as though the fast-induced sleepiness of the  village had worked its way inside her.  She said she felt tired, bone-tired, but more than that, I think  homesickness had overtaken her once again, unexpectedly. Whenever I entered her room I&rsquo;d find her  either looking at the photographic portraits of her children and Sir Alick that  had been sent to her at Christmas or sleeping with the photographs laid out  next to her divan, on her writing table. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those  evenings that my Lady was too unwell to join us, Omar and I continued with our  new tradition of sharing the meal, the windows of the salon flung open to the  night. As well as bats, the eaves of the  French House were populated by tiny owls that looked as though they had hopped  straight from a hieroglyphic frieze, and there was one that would sit on the  windowsill and watch us eat. By now the  night air was warm and soft but still cool enough to provide a welcome contrast  to the day. Omar and I would lie back on  the cushions and talk late into the evening; I think we were both surprised by  how much we had to say. &nbsp;And we said most  things at least twice, once in English, once in Arabic, with many digressions  and explanations along the way. I had  never spoken so freely with a man, and Omar had never spoken so freely with a  woman:&nbsp; I know this because he told me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I never met  my wife,&rsquo; he told me, one evening, &lsquo;before the day I married her.&rsquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t  seem to me like such a bad way of doing things,&rsquo; I said. I found myself thinking of the little maid,  Laura, who had got herself into such trouble in Esher. &lsquo;What was it like,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;the first time  you saw her?&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and  shook his head and when I did not understand his reply, said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have  enough words in either language.&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marvelled  at the conversation:&nbsp; a man had confided  in me. The night breeze ran across my  skin; the little owl hooted then flew away.  I felt as far from Esher  as it was possible to be; it was as though not only did I inhabit a different  land, but I inhabited a different body.
</p>
            <p>Luckily my Lady recovered from  this latest bout quickly and needed none of the special treatment that we all  so dreaded. She&nbsp; decided to mount an expedition to the Valley   of the Kings before the nights grew as hot as the  days. Omar organized the little ferryman  to take us across the river in the late afternoon, and donkeys to carry us once  we reached the other side. The path to  the Valley is long and winding, and for a time we travelled alongside the  fields where the crops were ripening.  The soil is so enriched by the annual summer inundation of the Nile that  farmers can plant two or sometimes three crops in rotation, and once the barley  and lentils have been harvested, they sow follow-on crops of maize and cotton  and sugar-cane;&nbsp; they use an ingenious  system of canals for irrigation, water-ways built in ancient times. The soil is black and rich and pungent as far  as the annual Nile  floods reach; but beyond that, as though a line has been drawn, the ground  turns scrappy and hard as the desert begins.  I find the division between the voluptuous green flood plain and the  white stony hills quite alarming, as though the land has issued a warning:&nbsp; go beyond here and you are doomed, beyond  here you will not survive. My heart sank  as our little procession turned away from the plain to head up into the Valley,  and I struggled not to show my apprehension; my Lady and Omar were so engaged  in their discussion of the landscape and the farmers that my Lady had met and  spoken with on previous outings to this side of the river &ndash; several of whom  came out to greet us as we made our way past their small-holdings &ndash; that they  did not notice the grim look on my face. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun began  to go down and the hills turned as red as hot coals in the dying fire of the  day; we reached the Valley at twilight  which in Egypt  gives a glorious soft warm light. Now  that we had been in the country for more than half a year, I felt I should be  accustomed to its beauty and its mysteries, but I was not, nor would I ever  be. The Egyptian people live among the  ruins of their former selves and they accept as given the strange and  monumental remnants of their past. A  whole valley, high up in the hills, where the tombs of kings and queens have  been carved deep underground into the stone, filled with treasure, then opened  and plundered and sealed and re-opened and plundered yet again. The bearers had brought torches with them and  we entered the tomb of the Pharaoh Sety.  The walls were painted in exquisite tableaus and the colours were perfect  and bright. Omar pointed out to me the  ceiling with its painted vultures flying toward the back of the tomb, and Sety  himself standing before falcon-headed Re, the Sun God. I felt awe-struck by what I was seeing; the  air in the tomb was very dry and the torches were burning hard, throwing out an  intense yellow light. I turned to my  Lady to say, once again, that I wished I could read and interpret the  hieroglyphics, but my Lady was deep in conversation with one of the  bearers. Instead of discussing the tomb  and its elaborate and meaning-laden decoration, as usual my Lady was asking the  bearer about his family &ndash; how many children, where did they live, were they all  healthy?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was  time to return home, we made our way out of the Valley of the Kings and mounted  our donkeys, my Lady and myself both complimenting each other on our  dress-sense which made riding a donkey if not comfortable, at least less  perilous and a little more dignified.  The bearers extinguished the torches and, for a moment, we were blinded  by the night. But night is not dark in  Egypt; the moon and stars were so bright and the night sky so clear that as we  came down from the Valley, the Nile was laid out before us in the distance,  more dream-like and gorgeous than any tomb painting. We picked our way out of the hills back  down the stony lane and the night was so quiet we were reminded of where we&rsquo;d  just been:&nbsp; the realm of the dead, a  valley of the dead, a place where the dead had been disturbed in their rest  over and over again.</p>            <P></td>
