              <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Like someone&rsquo;s presence, a  writer's voice is a tricky thing to pin down.  If James Wood characterises Saul Bellow's prose as 'jivey and broken and  rapid', or speaks of Dickens's 'bounciness', he isn't describing the sound they  make so much as the rhythms they move to, conceiving of voice as something more  kinetic than aural, which relates to their way of being in the world, their  attitude towards it, which will imply a particular perspective on things and so  determine the themes the writer is drawn to, and the ways in which those themes  are treated.</p>

          <td rowspan="3"><img name="home_r3_c6" src="../../images/spacer.gif" width="16" height="368" border="0" alt=""></td>

            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Many of the epithets we  use of voice are suggestive of personality, and so incline us to apply them to  the person of the writer. In the  particularity of his noticing and the scrupulousness of his describing - his  resistance to familiar formulations, the already seen, already said - the  writer expresses a point of view, a singularity of seeing, and this has a moral  dimension. The integrity of the writer's  engagement with language - and so, by ready implication, with life - will  either ring true or ring false to us. </p>
<p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">We may have to listen very  hard, though: almost as hard as the writer.  My own, somewhat unbouncy way of being in the world draws to me certain  themes - principally 'loss' and what Richard Ford calls the 'normal  applauseless life of us all' - but while my engagement with these themes  influences the things I notice, and the ways in which I describe them, I can  never be quite sure I'm noticing accurately enough, or describing clearly enough,  that I'm tackling loss without becoming mawkish, or describing the quotidian  without becoming boring. However hard I  listen, I can never quite <em>know</em> whether or not I'm ringing true. </p>
<p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">And faced with the anxiety  of <em>not knowing</em>, with the inherent  unreliability of words, my habitual defence is to reach after the consolations  of formal patterning - assonance, alliteration, half-rhyme, metrical and  rhythmical riffs - and to place these in the service of a particular cadence  that plays in my mind whenever I attempt to fix any words on the page.
<p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">It's an insistent cadence,  always there, and much of the effort of writing for me is dedicated to an  obsessive, compulsive pestering of the page to find the exact combination of  words that will allow me to express a particular thought or image or feeling in  tune with this tune in my head. And if I  can't find the exact cadence then that thought or image or feeling must remain  unexpressed. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
Which can be frustrating,  since it seems I can no more rid myself of this rhythm than I can rid myself of  myself. My identity is in some way bound  up with the aural aspect of voice, which makes the experience of being  translated oddly perplexing: how can these foreign words in this foreign grammar  possibly sound at all like me? How can  this first sentence, which I laboured over for days, continue to carry anything  like the same cadence? And - most odd  and perplexing of all - in the case of the Japanese, Korean or Hebrew books  that bear my name, how can this baffling script carry even the slightest  remnant of the sound of me? For all I  know, in Hebrew I sound just like Saul Bellow.&nbsp; </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
Recently, as a  writer-in-residence at the Summer School of the British Centre for Literary  Translation, I was able to watch the efforts of an Italian workshop group to  achieve not just a translation of part of my novel <em>What I Know,</em> but a translation of what they called the 'melody' of  those pages, my role being to adjudicate between the students' competing  'equivalences' to the rhythms of my sentences. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
I listened, and what I  heard each time was a version of Italian whose metre and patterns of  repetition, whose phrase-lengths and punctuation pauses, sounded uncannily  familiar, but which - I was told - fell on their Italian ears as  ever-so-slightly accented, as <em>foreign</em>. This, paradoxically, lent the translation  more authenticity - it sounded somehow 'English' - whereas any hint of  foreignness in the original would have been a measure of its inauthenticity,  and so of its failure. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
<em>What I Know </em>is the first person narration of a humdrum  private detective who discovers, aged forty, that he 'knows' a great deal about  the personal lives of strangers, but is a stranger to himself. He has amassed any number of facts about  other people, but has achieved very little self-knowledge. And so he turns the technology of his trade  upon those closest to him: he begins to investigate his family and friends,  hoping to discover what constitutes a 'life', to understand what makes his own  life tick. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
Self-revelation is key,  and his narrative of self-scrutiny and self-discovery centres on issues of  authenticity - which in part finds its expression in my authorial attempt to  achieve a <em>trueness</em> of tone in the  telling. And as I listened to the  passionately argued alternatives for the sound of his narration, I wondered if  a translation workshop was an &lsquo;equivalence&rsquo; of sorts for the process of  writing, the endlessly tiring tussle with language that Don DeLillo calls 'the  old, slow water-torture business of invention and doubt and  self-correction'. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
Clearly translation was as  effortful and conflicted a process as writing, but clearly, in one respect, a  translation into Italian is relatively unproblematic, given that so much of the  cultural and conceptual luggage will carry over. My collaboration with a Japanese translator  at the University of East Anglia, however, has brought home the difficulty of  rendering almost any English into Japanese without the need for potentially  cluttering contextualisations, irrespective of the problem of capturing the  author's 'melody'. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
Yoko Shimada is an  experienced translator of contemporary English writing who wanted to test the  notion of a 'simpatico' translation founded on congeniality and proximity by  attempting a translation of my novel <em>Crustaceans </em>while based for a year at UEA, where I teach. Her progress was premised on frequent  meetings during which she interrogated me about my intentions, and though at  first I floundered, I did eventually arrive at an understanding of what I'd  been up to, and was able to share this with her. But the cultural gap was there from the  outset; it was there on the spine of the book. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
<em>Crustaceans</em>&nbsp;is  called <em>Crustaceans</em> partly because I  liked the seaside sound of the word, this being a novel set by the seaside. The word also has iconic significance for the  narrator in that it's the first word he imagines teaching his new-born son to  pronounce: they will go beachcombing, he anticipates, 'gathering shells...  raiding rockpools for crabs'. And it has  thematic significance because the narrator, struggling with his son's  subsequent death, retreats into himself, into his shell. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
But it seems there&rsquo;s no  comparable word in Japanese for 'crustaceans', nothing that sounds like waves  breaking on shingle <em>and</em> carries the  same colloquial connotations of emotional reserve <em>and</em> can be found in most people's standard vocabulary: the nearest  equivalent is a specialist, zoological term that might - at its most economical  and musical (it does at least alliterate) - translate back into English as  'aquatic arthropods'. And what applies  here - before the book is even opened - applies equally elsewhere in the novel,  the problems posed for Yoko being typified by this simple sentence:&nbsp; </p>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><p>'My kitchen - a sink, drainer and Baby  Belling cooker - was built into a recess to the left of the chimney-breast, a  slatted partition to hide it.'</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Possibly in Italian 'Baby  Belling' would similarly fail to signify, though the context might guide the  reader towards a good-enough understanding; saving which, a native brand of  appliance might be substituted. But in  Japanese there is no concept of the contextualising 'chimney-breast', and what  I realised when asked to account for this sentence was just how far my choices  had been governed by sound, far more than I'd been fully conscious of when  writing. Yoko&rsquo;s task then was  many-sided, for whatever solutions she might arrive at for the sense of this  sentence, there would remain the problem of achieving an equivalence for the  alliteration of 'Baby', 'Belling', 'built' and 'breast', and the near-rhymes of  'recess' and 'breast', 'partition' and 'kitchen', 'drainer and 'cooker'.</p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
              This semi-conscious  attachment to musical patterning is everywhere in my work, I've come to  realise, another example being these two sentences from <em>What I Know</em>:</p>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><p>'I am a private investigator, and business  of late has been slack. My wife is a  teacher of maths.'</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Conversationally, the  Italians suggested, a more natural way for my detective to express himself  would be: 'My wife is a maths teacher.&rsquo;&nbsp;  But this alternative never occurred to me and the reason, I'm sure, is  because it wouldn't have allowed me to arrive at those two tidy phrases of  eight beats and the end-line assonance of 'slack' and 'maths'. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
              Such habitual tidiness is  one reason I will never, regrettably, sound like Saul Bellow - in any language  - though the experience of engaging with translators has brought me closer to  an understanding, I think, of what my 'cadence' consists of, and confirmed me  in the belief that my real challenge as a writer is not to achieve on the page  the cadence that plays in my mind, but to arrive at some other rhythms, some  less familiar patterns - and indeed this was the intention behind my latest, as  yet untitled novel, which is set in 1916 and derives from dozens of transcripts  of tape recordings I made while working as an oral historian some twenty years  ago. </p> <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">
          If I wrote <em>What I Know</em> partly because I thought I  knew how to do it (which lends the title an ironic inflection, an  acknowledgement of my failure to free myself from the security, or shackles, of  my usual method and style) this novel-in-progress was conceived partly out of  frustration with the limitations of what had become the overly familiar sound  of me. Derived from dozens of  individual, characterful voices - each of them distinct, all literally <em>spoken</em> - the effort to achieve the  singular, literary voice that might accommodate or alchemise them has forced me  to stretch to some significantly longer sentences and a far greater complexity  and flexibility of cadence. And  possibly, as one of the Italians suggested, the real effort is not so much to  translate into words the rhythms I move to, but to resist those rhythms and  reach after some different tunes, to rid myself of a few of my habitual riffs  and invent some new ones. Possibly the  real challenge faced by any writer in fact is not so much to find a voice, but  once having found one, to lose it.</p>            </td>
