             <p> Was I playing it in the hope of joy,<br>
              play it as it lays, as someone said,<br>
              playing it down or else playing it up,<br>&nbsp;<br>
              or was there some other raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre,<br>
              some other raisin drying in the sun,<br>
              or some other reason under the sun.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Please excuse my French, was there a reason<br>
              for being and doing anything else,<br>
              dreaming or dying for anything else.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              &ldquo;Be content with lack of misery&rdquo;<br>
              was a kind of motto for some of us,<br>
              a kind of bonbon or a platitude,<br>&nbsp;<br>
              or a kind of candy for a sucker<br>
              when what you need is a drink of sense,<br>
              the mot juste and a drink of joy or juice.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Drink up, drink up, or else drink it down,<br>
              have you ever pondered the difference?<br>
              Not a bon mot or else a play on words<br>&nbsp;<br>
              but a choice between rising and falling.<br>
              Or lay it aside, play it as you can,<br>
              when what you need is some balm for the heart,<br>&nbsp;<br>
              or else a pillow for your pretty head,<br>
              or a pill, or a grape plucked from the vine.<br>
              Maybe a surge, a surfeit or an urge<br>&nbsp;<br>
              or something urgent in the argument,<br>
              as though reasoning could be part of it:<br>
              some say a surge of joy might be killing.</p>

               <P><strong>Head</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
     
                No, I was thinking I would lose my head<br>
                when there was the emperor&rsquo;s man, and thwack&mdash;<br>
                it wasn&rsquo;t my hat that was missing.<br>&nbsp;<br>
                I was a sister or I was a saint,<br>
                maybe a gilded statue of Venus,<br>
                sporting a halo or wearing a hat,<br>&nbsp;<br>
                blood on my bosom or no blood at all,<br>
                gilding a lily or a gala gown;<br>
                I was the garderobe or the avant-garde<br>&nbsp;<br>
                with the guards at my back in the palace.<br>
                What was a bust without a head on it,<br>
                what was a dress without a girl in it,<br>&nbsp;<br>
                a dress or a bag, a drape or a rag.<br>
                Dear Lesbia and poor fat Drusilla,<br>
                an emporium of d&eacute;colletages<br>&nbsp;<br>
                or a model of empiricism.<br>
                No, &ldquo;please save me&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t a noble thought,<br>
                but save my face, at least that act of grace!<br>&nbsp;<br>
                All this was heady, which didn&rsquo;t mean smart;<br>
                it was the foam or the fizz, or the fat,<br>
              the cut of the gown, the slash of the neck.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Oh god, how I wanted to dance and dance,<br>
              <em>dress in a lily, shake myself silly</em>.<br>
              The thought wriggled up, but my head was gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              It could be me or my image in stone.<br>
              It might be a headstone or a hanger,<br>
              a headache maybe, or a hangover.   </P>

          <p><strong>Cant</strong>&nbsp;<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
            I said I could never live here, and I<br>
            never could, but I did for two decades&mdash;<br>
            I had fallen into a decadence.<br>&nbsp;<br>
            No, not a cadence, though that too could fall,<br>
            darkly&mdash;ever so darkly&mdash;through a glass,<br>
            or a mirror or a dirty window<br>&nbsp;<br>
            barred like a skeleton, barred like a cage.<br>
            Not as though I didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;I did care.<br>
            I had been carping on the debacle<br>&nbsp;<br>
            for most of ten years in the candlelight,<br>
            the decorum of the core of the deed,<br>
            decked in desire, here in my dark cave&mdash;<br>&nbsp;<br>
            decorated with me, or with my core,<br>
            the dark card of the dark lass and lady,<br>
            dandling on her lap my own life&mdash;my life&mdash;<br>&nbsp;<br>
            while I combed through the old crowns and papers.<br>
            It was tiny but cavernous, it was<br>
            cadaverous, it was my catacomb.<br>&nbsp;<br>
            But could I be decanted from this jar?<br>
            Cant! Cant! The cant of I can&rsquo;t&mdash;no, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;<br>
          comb out my hair, climb out of my lair and<br>&nbsp;<br>
          dance with the wind in the dandelions.<br>
          If the door was ajar, would I go out,<br>
          a cat darting her head around the door<br>&nbsp;<br>
          (carpe diem, carry away the day).<br>
          A canticle of anticipation,<br>
          some dandelion wine and a draft of air.</P></td>
