<strong><em>Winter of God</em></strong><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            In the summer, Lord, we idle, plotting our futures. <br>
            At your bidding, the seasons of spring and autumn <br>
            Are devoted to planting and harvest <br>
            In preparation for winter, your especial favourite. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Summer we remember <br>
            For the friend who shares his aloneness <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; with one other, <br>
            For the neighbour&rsquo;s daughter who runs naked <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; beneath the flourish of the palms, <br>
            For the angel who takes the name of my mother, <br>
            And for my father, and the strength of his endurance. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Yet how futile is summer when compared to your winter! <br>
            When you teach us to remember <br>
            That the day of celebration is always the day of our doom. <br>
            When you allow us to reap the fields of experience, <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; and then leave us <br>
            Because their fruits do not please you. <br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Now our dreams grow green beneath the mirrors <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; of your sky. <br>
            The stars gleam pink &ndash; the nipples of your virgins <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; in their hour of fertility. <br>
            Oh how often, Lord, do we take shelter in prayer, <br>
            Asking for memory to be erased, <br>
            For the autumn to lie as deep as our desires, <br>
            And for spring to offer its dark promise of fertility. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            And yet the treachery of winter lies deeper still. <br>
            &nbsp;<br>

            &nbsp; <br>
            Winter bares the tree to a solitary nest. <br>
            Rain drips through its mesh of twigs. <br>
            Snow embalms it in a wreath of soft cotton. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            That nest is as heavy as <br>
            The silence which clogs my ears, <br>
            Or the smoke which weighs on my lungs. <br>
            It penetrates my dreams, where night <br>
            Is driving and driving its nails. <br>

            </span><strong><em>The Forgotten City</em></strong><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Late afternoon. <br>
            The houses are shaded in the lightest of pencil strokes. <br>
            Birds have flown, nests long abandoned. <br>
            Wind flourishes its whips of cold, freezing the tongue; <br>
            Echoes of footfalls; leaves falling; <br>
            Rags and tatters of newsprint. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Birds have flown, their nests long abandoned. <br>
            You too, o errant sand dweller, <br>
            Have left nothing but footprints, <br>
            Having stared at the waves too late, and for too long. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Once the sun burnt the wrist of the city. <br>
            Now it has cooled to a silver bracelet, <br>
            Worn once, now long gone, my forgotten lady. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp; <br>

            <strong><em>Wall</em></strong><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            I shut the door &ndash; rain flings into my face &ndash; <br>
            And make for the nearest bar. <br>
            I am free as any stranger in a city. <br>
            I have no kin to worm its way beneath my skin. <br>
            I am a brick in a wall, <br>
            Which will soon be added to other walls, <br>
            And then &ndash; hey presto! &ndash; a fort. <br>
            Inside my head, muffled by its hat, <br>
            I am calming the cries of some woman. <br>
            Rain douses her too. The tongue is silenced. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Two glasses, dear waiter. <br>
            One is for me. <br>
            The other is&hellip;still to come. <br>
            You will know her by her coat, of wool. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            The waiter, a customary type, <br>
            Reads the mind of the addict to perfection. <br>
            Another customer waits.<br>
            He nods - and hurries away. <br>

            <strong><em>Night&rsquo;s Scavengers</em></strong><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            These scavengers for wood beside the Thames, <br>
            I take in their glutinous, brown, tar-like stink. <br>
            In the sieve of their thick, matted hair, <br>
            They trap all the dirt and the darkness of London. <br>
            Their exile shelters, nurtures them in silence. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            I too am a scavenger,<br>
            I too am an exile , <br>
            Looking to join them,<br>
            Born again, <br>
            A scavenger of words beside the Thames.<br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            But their exile is deeper than mine. <br>
            I see their make-shift shelters from the rain &ndash; <br>
            Boxes, slumped against concrete walls &ndash; <br>
            And how they coil inside, <br>
            Intoxicated spirits, <br>
            Eyelids heavy with numbness. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            For warmth, I squat in a phone booth, staring out. <br>
            A sparrow of ice alights. <br>
            A woman&rsquo;s lips leave a promise on the glass. <br>
            My palm throbs between cheek and pillow. <br>
            The smell of weaning plugs my nostrils. <br>
            I hear the gentle swish-swish of autumn foliage. <br>
            A train on some nearby platform sighs. <br>
            A suitcase hesitates to move. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>

            <strong><em>Seeing and Calling</em></strong><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            The god I have always denied enters the house. <br>
            My father, lying in white, is in his death agonies. <br>
            My mother, sisters, brother, half-circled around Him, <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; avert their eyes. <br>
            Only I have seen the god coming in. <br>
            Only I am trying not to look at him. <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            The god is crying, this god I have always denied. <br>
            He is full of compassion, pity. <br>
            The shadow of death hangs over the family. <br>
            Soon there will be nothing but darkness. <br>
            A void will engulf my father&rsquo;s body. <br>
             <br>
            <em>We are listening.</em><br>
            <em>Our sole right is to beg him.</em><br>
            <em>We cannot ask the question which is always on our lips,</em><br>

            <em>From such frustration flows our bitterness.</em><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Bent-backed is the god, smitten by time, <br>
            A ruined building, sole refuge now <br>
            For refugees from who knows where. <br>
            He slips away, so cautiously, <br>
            And, patiently, unseen, I follow after, <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            Both lost, in the way a star is lost, <br>
            through desert dust, and mirages <br>
            of water, which ever recedes from us, <br>
            and travellers who went before...<br>
            The bones repeat the voice of the winds.<br>
             <br>
            Across wind-lashed spaces, the wolves howl on. <br>
