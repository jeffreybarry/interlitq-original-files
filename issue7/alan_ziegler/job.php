            <p align="center"><strong>ON  THE </strong><strong>ROAD</strong><strong> TO  GOPHERWOOD </strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>(1970)</strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jocelyn is the  only female professor in the English department.&nbsp; I take a contemporary poetry class with her,  and she acquaints me with William Carlos Williams and the poetry of colloquial  speech (&ldquo;wassama?&rdquo; in <em>Paterson</em>). I  don&rsquo;t know it then, but it is my first step toward a life in a direction I  never even considered. Her husband, Dave, teaches English at Albany State.  When he is turned down for tenure, students protest, to no avail. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jocelyn and Dave  decide to do what many people talk about in: drop out. They buy land in Barry&rsquo;s  Bay, Ontario, Canada, and  re-start their lives as farmers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich and I make  plans to visit them in September, 1970. Early on a Sunday morning, we fly  half-fare to Ottawa on  expired college ID&rsquo;s and start hitching from Ottawa at 9:30 a.m. At around noon, we get stuck in an intersection. Cars  slow down and look at us and drive on. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally a family  picks us up &ndash; a man and wife and two kids. The man has a French accent and is  drinking beer. He talks about how he&rsquo;ll pick up anybody because he was in the  army for 22 years and was on the road a lot. He curses out the farmers in the  area, and says they won&rsquo;t pick up anyone who looks like a hippie. He drives us  around town so that everybody can see he&rsquo;s picked us up.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tells us he is  an outcast in that area because &ldquo;I drink and I&rsquo;m free. I get money from the  army, and people are jealous because I don&rsquo;t have to work my land hard.&rdquo; He was  wounded several times and his &ldquo;legs are almost useless.&rdquo; We share a common  ground as outcasts. He drops us off a few miles outside of town.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it looks  like there is no way we&rsquo;ll make it to Barry&rsquo;s Bay by dark, a bus comes along  that says <em>Barry&rsquo;s Bay</em> and we flag it  down after looking at each other to make sure we aren&rsquo;t hallucinating. There  are no passengers, and the only reason the driver is completing the trip is to  deliver the newspapers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to charge. How about a dollar?&rdquo;  Deal.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We get to Barry&rsquo;s  Bay at dusk, but the only cab driver in town has to deliver the newspapers. He  gives us directions to a guy who might take us out to the farm. The guy isn&rsquo;t  home but his father-in-law invites us to come in and wait. He is in his  seventies and has a horrible smoker&rsquo;s cough. His whole body convulses when he  coughs and the coughs bring no clearing or satisfaction. He is chain-smoking  hand-rolled cigarettes. The only thing that interrupts his smoking is his  coughing, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His son-in-law  never shows up, so Rich and I head back toward town, to spend the night in the  one hotel. We stop at the bar, where we meet some teenagers. They were raised  in Barry&rsquo;s Bay but now live in nearby towns and only come home to get drunk at  the hotel. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kids  volunteer to take us out to the farm in their truck. It is a moonless night,  and the driver speeds along the narrow, rough gravel road, mostly on the wrong  side of the imaginary white line. Everyone whoops each time the truck skids  around a curve. Rich and I say nothing. If another car comes along we have no  chance. We choose to risk death rather than be uncool with strangers (who may  choose to kill us anyway).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We make it to the  end of the road; we have to go the rest of the way on foot. Rich and I grope  toward the light of the cabin, which seems a Christina&rsquo;s-World away. As we get  closer we hear a dog bark, then see a flashlight, which leads us to Jocelyn&rsquo;s  welcoming embrace. I have never hugged a teacher before.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things aren&rsquo;t  working out well for Jocelyn and Dave and their three-year-old daughter. They  have been working for years on a major anthology of contemporary poetry, and  were counting on the royalties to subsidize the farm; but their publisher has  been sold and the new owners dropped the project. Some relatives sent them an  expensive shortwave radio to link them to the world, but they are going to sell  it to get them through the winter. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich and I help  harvest the last of the vegetable garden. Dave asks me to ride along with him  to shop for some meat at the nearest supermarket. He parks in the back lot and  takes me to the dumpster, where we scavenge for sealed packages of  recently-expired chicken. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning Jocelyn  wakes up to find a bear carcass near the front door. She deduces that a  neighbor, knowing they can&rsquo;t afford meat, left it there. Jocelyn marinates the  meat for days, and my mouth waters whenever I pass it. Finally, on our last  night there, with winter setting in, the garden barren, and the radio gone, Jocelyn  serves the bear meat. I chew and chew and chew until I can swallow, thinking of  Chaplin eating his shoelace.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jocelyn and Dave labeled their  mailbox <em>Gopherwood</em>. When I get home,  I look up <em>gopherwood</em> and discover it  is from the Old Testament: &ldquo;Make thee an ark in gopherwood; rooms shalt then  make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with gopherwood and this  is the fashion which thou shalt make it of.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="center"><strong>VISITORS  ON THE ROOF </strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>(1975)</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In  June I meet a couple of Chicago poets browsing in the Eighth Street  Bookstore, and we exchange poems during the year, publish in each other&rsquo;s  magazines. They return to New York the following autumn, bringing along  three friends, and they camp out in my living room. Five strangers in my apartment,  so happy to be together in New York, talking of people and places I don&rsquo;t  know. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  start to feel like the outsider in my own home. I retreat to the roof, alone,  where it is dark and chilly. I withdraw deeper into myself, and I fear going  back down, where someone will surely ask me what&rsquo;s wrong, are you all right? &ndash;  questions I hate because I fear my face betrays a secret I have not yet told  myself.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One  of the visitors &ndash; whom I just met &ndash; joins me and says, &ldquo;You must spend a lot of  time up here. Wow, you can see the river. There goes a ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;  I lie, having only gone up on summer days to tan, never looking at the river  long enough to see a ship.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  are joined by another, and another, till all five are now with me once again,  all of us visiting. They ask questions about my life; no one mentions my  sadness, maybe they can&rsquo;t see it in the dark. I feel my teeth beginning to  chatter, but now that we are getting along, I don&rsquo;t want to go downstairs,  which might make them think I am avoiding them.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone  appears with wine &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t notice him go back down. A few minutes later,  someone else brings me a sweater. When the wine is gone, we return to the  apartment, together. Soon they are all asleep in the living room, two on a  couch, one in a chair, and two in sleeping bags. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  go to my room, warm and happy, eager for breakfast.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p align="center"><strong>FROZEN YOGURT WATCH </strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>(1978)</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I buy my first  digital watch &ndash; when they are high-tech &ndash; through a mail order deal. I pay for  the basic $19.95 model, though I lust after the $79.95 version with multiple  features. Two months later, I find the coveted attempted-delivery slip in my  tiny mailbox. Seconds after leaving the post office, I open the box and am  surprised and thrilled to discover the expensive model &ndash; a mistake I am willing  to live with.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spend an hour  poring over the directions, setting time zones and calendars and learning how  to measure elapsed time (down to the tenth of a second). I start timing  everything, from shaving to phone conversations. I am running five or six days  a week, and I time my various routes and interim sprints, keeping track of  personal bests.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After running, I  usually treat myself to a frozen yogurt, at a tiny store recently opened, the  first of its kind on the Upper West Side. In mid-November,  a sign in the window reads: <em>Get your  treats early in the evening, with bad weather we close early. And soon like all  birds, we fly south.</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go in for what  may be my last frozen yogurt of the season, and the guy behind the counter asks  to see my watch. He explains that he is in the market for a new watch and he  asks what mine can do. I proudly run through all the functions, and he says he  wants one, where should he go. I tell him about the mail order.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But where would  I go to get mine? I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don't know. I  guess Macys is worth a try.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He writes it  down.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get a call from a woman who says she  works for a fulfillment house. I tell her that sounds like an intriguing place  to work. She replies that the wrong watch has been sent to a number of people,  and if I received the wrong one I can  send it back for exchange. &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;If I did, I'd be glad to, but I  didn't, gotta run, bye.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that  afternoon, while running in Riverside Park, I fantasize about someone stopping  me, asking for today's date and, when I find the answer on my wrist, saying,  &ldquo;You're busted; interstate fraud.&rdquo; I laugh and pick up my pace. I check my  watch: I have a good shot at bettering my four-mile record of 28 minutes and  4.3 seconds. I can hurdle the multiple-seven-minute-mile barrier.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pump my legs  harder as I approach the tennis courts at 116th    Street. A ball comes flying over the fence and  bounces into a bush about twenty yards ahead of me. &ldquo;A little help?&rdquo; a guy in  tennis whites yells.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was  growing up in Brooklyn,  there was an unspoken vow to respond to any playground call for &ldquo;a little  help.&rdquo; But I never stop in the middle of a run, fearing that the aerobic chain  would snap. Plus, there is a personal best to be had. &ldquo;Sorry, I can't stop,&rdquo; I  yell, speeding up to show I am a runner, not a jogger. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, run away,  you asshole,&rdquo; the guy screams and waves his racket in my direction. The word <em>asshole</em> coats my guilt with anger. Why  should I run an errand for some tennis-playing-venture-capitalist-attorney?&nbsp; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back,  I keep my head down as I approach the tennis courts. Another ball flies over  the fence. &ldquo;Ooh, can you fetch our ball, please?&rdquo; This time a sweet woman's  voice. Oh hell, I am getting winded anyway; who knows where this retrieval  could lead? Then I hear the venture-capitalist-attorney say, &ldquo;Don't ask that  asshole, he doesn't stop for anyone.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This guy isn't  taking me seriously as an athlete. I turn to face him, and without breaking  stride yell, &ldquo;Why don't you stop your game and tie my shoes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him come  after me. My third wind is kicking in. I start my stretch run a quarter of a  mile before usual. Not used to running so fast on the narrow part of the path,  I veer off and feel my arm scrape along the fence, followed by a jolt and a  twinge in my arm socket. When I regain stride, I check to see how much time  I've lost. The watch-face dangles from the strap; the display is blank. My  shoulder aches. I finish my run, dizzy from hyperventilation. I'll never know  if I have broken the multiple-seven-minute mile. And I can't send the watch  back for repair.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A  few months later I go in for my first frozen yogurt of the spring, and the same  guy is behind the counter, in animated conversation with a customer. He points  to his wrist and I hear him say: &ldquo;And look, it's a stop watch, and an alarm  clock, and....&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p align="center"><strong>ON THE </strong><strong>ROAD</strong><strong> TO </strong><strong>LEE</strong><strong> </strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>(1991 / 93)</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick loves to  drive and doesn't mind going out of his way &ndash; he once drove from New    Orleans to Tallahassee to  have lunch with a friend. I am going to visit him at Interlochen, and he tells  me about a low fare to Grand Rapids,  offering to pick me up at the airport. My plane arrives an hour late, and I  meet Nick at the bar. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been  driving for about an hour when I ask him how much farther. He says it is  another hour and a half. Nick is spending five hours in the car just to pick up  a friend at the airport; he's not the only one who would do that, but few do it  as naturally.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are hardly  any other cars on the highway, with darkness on either side, and many miles  between exits that lead to deeper darkness. We pass a sign for <em>Lee: One Mile</em>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever  been to Lee?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never heard of  it,&rdquo; Nick says.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a minute  later we whiz past a hitchhiker. &ldquo;Did you see that guy?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, who'd stop  here? I'd stop. But I'm not going to back up on this road.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How the hell did  he get that far, and no farther?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Guess his last  ride was turning off at Lee.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or he's from  Lee.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We say it  simultaneously: &ldquo;He <em>is</em> Lee.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee becomes our  code word for anyone physically or emotionally adrift in the world.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of years  later, Nick and I converge in Tallahassee.  After my visit, I am to take a bus to Jacksonville,  from where I will fly to New York.  Nick drives me to the Tallahassee bus  terminal. Until the bus actually pulls out, I think Nick may change his mind  and drive me to the Jacksonville  airport and hang out with me until my 8:00   a.m. flight. But Nick looks tired. As the bus pulls out, I shiver in  the back seat and wish the two soldiers wouldn't talk so loud. I realize that  Nick and I are starting to get a little old, and I feel a pang of terror.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus station  in Jacksonville is  bright and busy at 3 a.m. I  walk around, squinting in the fluorescent glare, picturing myself in 40 years a  lunatic roaming Broadway babbling about how the general downfall has been  caused by fluorescent lighting.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of dozen  guys are hanging around, looking like a casting call for a grade-B thriller set  in a southern town where a New York Jew is stranded and terrorized. Looking for  a taxi, I pass a vending machine. I never eat candy bars, but the Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s  Crunch looks awfully good so I eat one and buy one for later.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find the taxi  stand, where three guys are playing cards. When I ask if I can get a cab to a  motel near the airport, one smiles and says, &ldquo;It's my turn; I got this one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find out why he  is so eager for the fare when we are going 70 on a highway, darkness completely  around us, the meter clicking in a steady staccato rhythm, up to $45 before I  see the first glimmer of man-made light &ndash; a motel. The driver pulls over.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where's the  airport?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it's around  the bend a ways. The motel will take you there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give him three  twenties, which he stuffs with magician's speed into his pocket. I don't ask  for change. The cab screeches away and I walk up the path to the motel. By the  time I see the <em>No Vacancy</em> sign, the  cab's rear lights are extinguished by the distance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lobby is  locked. I toss my bag over my shoulder and return to the highway. A cool  drizzle starts. How far is the bend? How long is a &ldquo;ways&rdquo;?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain feels  refreshing after the stuffy bus. The airport can&rsquo;t be too far away. A few stars  make pinholes of light through a clearing patch on the horizon. I remember the  Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Crunch, and take small bites as I walk. It tastes even better than the  last one. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear the roar  of a car. I turn around and squint at the brights. I wave. The car doesn&rsquo;t even  slow down.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have become  Lee, and it isn't so bad.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="center"><strong>FAMILY FEUD&nbsp; </strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>(1997)</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My  wife and I whisper-argue in the bedroom while my father lies on the sofa bed in  the living room watching <em>Family Feud</em>.  I would appreciate the irony if my father wasn&rsquo;t having surgery in the morning  for advanced colon cancer.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He  was diagnosed only a week ago, though he was suffering for months &ndash; too weak  emotionally to go to the doctor but too strong physically to have no choice, until  his system started shutting down and he had no choice. The doctor immediately sent  him a few blocks away to a surgeon, a rotund, jolly fellow rated by <em>New York Magazine</em> as one of the best.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be dancing the tarantella in six weeks,&rdquo; the jolly surgeon told my  father, referring to my brother&rsquo;s wedding. I thought: I&rsquo;ll be happy if he&rsquo;s  alive in a week.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  leave my wife in the bedroom, hoping my father hasn&rsquo;t overheard our quibbling.  My father&rsquo;s hospital pajamas are in a plastic supermarket bag, his blue slacks  draped over a chair. He is wearing baggy boxer shorts and a white T-shirt. He  is engrossed in The Feud.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So  that&rsquo;s the new host,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the show without Richard  Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,  he&rsquo;s been on for a few years now. He&rsquo;s really grown into the job. I like him.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  can tell that my father is rooting for this man who landed a dream job  succeeding a popular host on a popular show. The new host chats easily with the  boisterous, healthy-looking families, and smiles sweetly when they jump up and  down, hugging in celebration of their &ldquo;good answers.&rdquo; I start to like him. I  sit on the edge of the sofa bed with my cancer-ridden father while my wife  fumes at me from the bedroom and my father&rsquo;s wife is long dead.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My  father will get through the surgery, and he will attend my brother&rsquo;s wedding  (though he won&rsquo;t dance the tarantella), and whatever is ailing my marriage will  dissolve in the suspension of love. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In  subsequent years, I will read in the obituaries that the jolly surgeon died  suddenly of a massive heart attack and that the charming new host hung himself  with bedsheets in a closet of a psychiatric ward. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My  father will live to mourn them both.</p>
