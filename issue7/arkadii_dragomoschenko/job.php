              <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">The notes and correspondence of Gustave  Flaubert: <em>On Literature, Art, and Writing</em>, in Russian, two volumes,  purchased for next to nothing from the flea market by the Museum of Railroads, where loudspeakers mumble at you continuously  from the museum&rsquo;s basement. It used metal-cast type. I could&rsquo;ve haggled over  the book, but it was already so (irresistibly) cheap that I just decided to &ldquo;go  with it.&rdquo;</p>

          <td colspan="4" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="texto2"><p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Do you remember the days when people still used  to ask each other: &ldquo;What are they selling today?&rdquo; You probably don&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;re  still young, and anyway, what&rsquo;s the use of mixing beautiful fairy tales with  stories from those nightmarish days. The backdrop to these memories unfolds and  then darkens like the lines in a developing photograph exposed to too much  light. Look at it long enough, without interruption, and you&rsquo;ll start seeing  signs of the twilight to come. Our photograph sinks into darkness. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">On a number of occasions, Ivan Alekseyevich  Bunin refers to the strange, somewhat morbid impression left on him by a  picture published in <em>Niva</em>, the illustrated journal; the picture had the Alps in the background, and an image of a short muscular man with a  disproportionately large head. Under the picture, Bunin wrote, &ldquo;There was an  inscription&mdash;&lsquo;<em>An encounter with a cretin from the mountains</em>.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s hard  to say how many actual cretins I&rsquo;ve seen in my life . . .&rdquo; </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">So, it&rsquo;s morning. According to all the signs,  it looks like the finches had a feast here. Gertrude Stein was born on February  3rd. Snow is snow is snow, which is just an adaptation of the famous sentence  from her lecture &ldquo;Poetry and Grammar,&rdquo; which she used as an example of pure  poetry&mdash;the possibility of narration without a beginning or ending. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">It&rsquo;s either the snow or the dirt that&rsquo;s  irritating my eyes. While I&rsquo;m running my myopic finger over Stein&rsquo;s famous  lines&mdash;&ldquo;He had dreamed that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were  depicted in his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of  white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float in autumn  and which Dessalles called <em>les fils de la Vierge</em>&rdquo;&mdash;two cretins and a  singer are arguing on TV about how the English language was invented by people  who didn&rsquo;t know how to pronounce sounds properly. They may be right. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Perhaps, too, we might be witnessing the return  of a certain social need&mdash;it&rsquo;s difficult to say. I&rsquo;m not so good at arguments  and figuring out who hit whom. As an example, one of the TV people brings up an  anecdote about some Englishman who couldn&rsquo;t pronounce the word &ldquo;<em>pyl&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;  with a soft <em>L</em> in Russian. So, instead of &ldquo;dust,&rdquo; the stupid Englishman  kept saying &ldquo;heat&rdquo; (&ldquo;<em>pyl</em>&rdquo;).</p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Gertrude Stein once said something that was  almost as famous as the sentence alluded to above (though less popular&mdash;after  all, the other one was about a rose). She said: &ldquo;You are all a lost  generation.&rdquo; The consequences were astounding and well known to everyone. But  let&rsquo;s assume that our scheduled rain got lost in the suburbs. Would this change  anything? The rain got cancelled and instead, today, we have snowflakes sifting  in everywhere. In order to lose something, you first need to have it. To have  and have not, yet another name emerging from my memory, which doesn&rsquo;t change a  thing in our ongoing recollections, however. This is what Clifton Fadiman said  about Stein: &ldquo;She was a past master in making nothing happen very slowly.&rdquo;  Isn&rsquo;t memory very much like a &ldquo;past master&rdquo; that&rsquo;s good for nothing?</p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Aren&rsquo;t we compelled to remember things over and  over again? Which reminds me that certain computer games don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;save&rdquo;  function, so that you can never return to a previous moment.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">At this moment, however, this &ldquo;past master&rdquo; can  easily be misread or mistaken for a &ldquo;postmaster&rdquo;: a mediator, a dispatcher of  messages. Some of these messages reach us intact, having kept their original  meanings, but still&mdash;it&rsquo;s necessary to understand them &ldquo;over again,&rdquo; as though  they never had a past. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">In the meantime, in an increasingly heated  atmosphere, the advocates of correct pronunciation continue their debate,  bringing concrete proofs and examples of how the language in which they  communicate is, by comparison, perfect. One of these cretins is a well-known  journalist. And what else should we expect from a singer? </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">What more can we add, my friend, after reading  this: &ldquo;We are entering a rather sad epoch here in France. And I, too, am becoming like the epoch.&rdquo; </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">And isn&rsquo;t the following remark also  fascinating? &ldquo;The Marquis de Sade forgot two things, cannibalism and predators,  and this proves how even the greatest of people are not so great, and besides  he should have ridiculed vice too, which he didn&rsquo;t do, and that was his  mistake.&rdquo; </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">For my own part, I&rsquo;ll try my best to not make  any mistakes. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">I won&rsquo;t call you, I won&rsquo;t think of you, I won&rsquo;t  even write about you, regardless of the enticing opening of this piece&mdash;about  the morning and the finches&mdash;which got lost along the way, and which has been  begging me relentlessly to continue it ever since. Any direct address creates a  dangerous illusion of the validity of what&rsquo;s being recounted. By which I mean,  imagine a person, standing alone at some crossroads or in a little town square,  addressing a void: &ldquo;How are you? What&rsquo;s going on? Would it have killed you to  call?&rdquo; and so on. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a scenario like this if we don&rsquo;t  acknowledge this person&rsquo;s absolute right to his madness: i.e., his right to  establish his own routes of communication. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Now I look at my glass of beer&mdash;great, because  nowadays it&rsquo;s possible to do so even in an opera house&mdash;and try to remember which  awards some Chilean wine has won, trying (in vain) to find an appropriate if  somewhat abstract plot for a future column, and simultaneously remembering a  photograph of the Mechnikov Hospital where the twilight is settling on its  gauze-like glass. Did you sell the car, the shells from the coast, the Eileen  Fisher dress? </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">To tell you the truth, what I liked best was  watching you look at the pecked rowanberries through the window, watching you  stomp on your dress with both your feet, hearing you get in the shower and  shout from there that we&rsquo;d never be together again. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Direct speech presupposes the certainty that  one can actually overcome the lack of expression in a given language and indeed  the possibility that the original content of your speech might be meaningless.  I should remember to add in a few more lines from Gertrude Stein (Why her,  though? Why not, for example, Marcus Aurelius or Viktor Pelevin? Can everything  be explained by the given hierarchy of the stars?): &ldquo;Identity is recognition,  you know who you are because you and others remember anything about yourself  but essentially you are not that when you are doing anything. I am I because my  little dog knows me but creatively speaking the little dog knowing that you are  you and your recognizing that he knows, that is what destroys creation. That is  what makes school.&rdquo;</p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Because nobody went to school, because it&rsquo;s  still morning and there are no finches in sight, while the pecked, rotten  rowanberries stick underfoot and fingers are dancing across the keyboard:  &ldquo;Everything is covered in frost. Do you know how beautiful you are in the  morning, when the windows are covered in frost, on the day that Stein was born,  when tides of grammar wash the shores of slumbering mirror-like images, and  three people talk on the flickering TV screen, forced between its lines as  though with a crowbar, feeling their way, unbearably slow, through the  wordless tracks and outlines there, which, if we squint, become nothing more  than regular patterns; these people, who, like Flaubert [let&rsquo;s carefully put  this paragraph in scare quotes], argue about the problems of language, its use,  and also about its elusive, subtle gradations of meaning, and perhaps even  about love&mdash;without which it&rsquo;s quite impossible to write&mdash;in whose absence someone  is still talking incessantly to someone else, because you have disappeared <em>from  my side</em> [which I&rsquo;ve put in italics here, despite its being omitted in the  original text], disappeared like some eloquent phrase, because this is how  various conditions must be described&mdash;but turn around, and you appear in a  flash, turn around again and you disappear, so there&rsquo;s no need to address you  in so mysteriously direct a fashion.&rdquo;<strong> </strong></p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">But one shouldn&rsquo;t turn around. Because  eventually things get dull, and with time everything will become mundane. How  to get interested again. I wrote about large buildings in a different city. It  seemed to me that the concept of the Tower of Babel has been completely misinterpreted by the  people who are still arguing over the problems of translation. For them, the  confusion of tongues exists, linguistically, as some inert spatial figure, a  level field, whereas we should see it instead as an axis, with the Tower at its  center&mdash;various languages spinning around it, regularly appearing and then  disappearing into the darkness, inert. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">I won&rsquo;t try to hide it: I also wrote about the  horizon, which breaks out before you even get a chance to breathe in the  sunrise, racing over the roofs of the big houses. Your absence, and the absence  of those buildings&mdash;what this book was supposed to be about&mdash;is replaced instead  with a multitude of descriptions. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">I was thinking of dust particles as I was  describing the stones. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">. . . Then the TV offers me advice on how to  raise flowers, how to get train tickets when there&rsquo;s a rush, and, most  importantly, how to fill out my tax return painlessly. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">Then begins a <em>vita nuova</em>, because, to be  sure, it was morning and, soon, night. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:14.15pt;">With a feeling of synchronicity the perception  of velocity begins its slow trickle into our consciousness. </p>
