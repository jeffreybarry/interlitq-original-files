            <br><p><em>Introduction: </em></p>
            <p>What follows is a radio-phonic version of the opening of my book, <em>Someone  Called Derrida</em>, which is a real-life murder mystery centred  on the famous French philosopher, Jacques Derrida&rsquo;s complex relationship to the  University of Oxford and the&nbsp; final years of my own father, years overwhelmed by dementia and nightmare. Every factual detail is, as far as I can  tell, correct.&nbsp; The same applies to the  voices you shall hear; they too are exact, verbatim. <strong></strong>My father&rsquo;s words are as transcribed at the time by my mother, and  Derrida&rsquo;s words come directly from a single book of his called <em>The Post Card</em> (1979). </p>
<P><strong>MUSIC:  the opening of </strong><strong>Vaughan</strong><strong> Williams&rsquo;<em> An Oxford Elegy, </em>to be used as a  refrain throughout the play.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MYSELF: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  It  is late, and I am reading. The book I  read is by someone called <br>
  Derrida, a strange philosopher. And his book, it is also strange <br>
  because the philosopher,  you see, does not seem to know the person about <br>
  whom he is supposed to  be writing. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <em>(Slowly</em>) &nbsp;<br>I  truly believe that I am singing someone who is dead and that I <br>
  <em>did not know.</em><br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br>  Still more strange is that I am  beginning to imagine that this someone is <br>
  my  father. After all, he is dead and the  philosopher did not know him. <br>
  &hellip;  This, I know, is absurd. They are, or  were, so very different - my <br>
  father  being no philosopher But he is definitely dead, and Derrida <br>
  certainly  did not know him. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>They did not know each other, but &hellip;they  form a couple &hellip;just because of <br>
  that. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> Philosopher  and pastor <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: (Parenthetically)<br> An odd couple. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>It is  true. But I shall point out that they were both born in 1930; both wrote <br>
  censored love letters  from Oxford; and both (here I  hesitate)&hellip;  both <br>
  suffered, or seemed to  have suffered, some kind of childhood calamity in <br>
  the middle of the Second  World War. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  NARRATOR: <br>In  September 1942, someone called Derrida into his study. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> The  school officer has me come into his office: &lsquo;<em>You</em> are going home, my <br>
  little friend.&rsquo;<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF<em>: </em><br>The  boy, just twelve years old, is leaving because he is Jewish; he must <br>
  leave school for  home. Exactly one year later, in England, another  boy <br>
  (my father) goes the  other way, leaving home for school. He  is thirteen <br>
  and is beginning at boarding-school  where something happens, <br>
  something quite  terrible; or rather, it <em>may</em> have  happened. &hellip; All I have <br>
  to go on is that, at  around the age of 60, after several years of premature <br>
  dementia my father slowly  disappeared. He  seemed to understand almost <br>
  nothing that we said,  just as we understood almost nothing that he said; <br>
  but then, we did not  really want to understand, since he seemed to describe <br>
  a series of appalling  events &hellip;.Well, perhaps not events. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: (Gently)<br> Disaster - we have <em>dreamed</em> of it, no? <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Yes &ndash; my father, he may have dreamed of  it. But if so, he was dreaming <br>
  of it every day for the  last five years of his life, and my mother, she heard <br>
  it all, and set it down  even as he spoke. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER:<br> It was lethal&hellip;. Hanging&hellip; They were kicking  him. Just shut the <br>
  door. He is  murdering me&hellip;. 666&hellip;. I must  telephone. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The  boy did, finally, telephone. I think he  meant to make the call in 1943, <br>
  but it took him fifty  years to do so, fifty years before he could get through. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> I tried to call you but it was busy, then no answer, you must <br>
  have gone out. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> When  he did get through it was not just my mother who picked up the<br>
  phone; it was also, I think, the philosopher, for he was no stranger  to <br>
  peculiar phone calls. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  NARRATOR: <br>In 1979  someone called Derrida, it was someone called Martin <br>
  Heidegger, even though  he, Heidegger, had died three years before. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> On 22 August while typing the words, &lsquo;from  Freud and from <em>Heidegger</em>&rsquo; <br>
  the telephone rings. The operator asks me if I accept a &lsquo;call&rsquo;  from <br>
  Martin Heidegger. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>With  messages coming in from the dead as well as the living, the<br>
  philosopher&rsquo;s switchboard is burdened with interference, with noises  off. <br>
  And these are terrible noises: the noise of -<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>All  the cruelty in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Even  -<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> The  worst concentration of evil: To the devil with the child, the <br>
  child, the child. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> You  can, perhaps, see why I dream that the philosopher got my father&rsquo;s <br>
  call, my father&rsquo;s 666  call. And I dream it again when the  philosopher <br>
  looks round and asks:<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>Who is he afraid of, this child?<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>And his  book, the philosopher&rsquo;s book, it is, stuffed with dead children.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> For the children, the holocaust has already  begun.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>As  if this, or they, were not enough, there is also -<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>Norbert,  my dead younger brother.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  NARRATOR: <em>(Parenthetically)</em> <br>He who died of  meningitis at the age of two<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br> And as if <em>he</em> were not enough, there is also - <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>Paul&hellip;the  little brother dead before me. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br> Poor boy, dead boy. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>But which boy is this now? Which boy are we mourning? The boy erased <br>
  by meningitis? The boy they had called Paul? The boy expelled for being <br>
  a Jew? The thousands of boys that were lost in the  Holocaust? Or, <br>
  simply the boy that was  my father? Or, perhaps, the boy my  father <em>says</em> he <br>
  saw being killed; if  there ever was such a boy, such a never never boy. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br>He&rsquo;s dead!  That poor little boy&hellip;I saw them bring him out screaming. <br>
  &hellip; He was hanging...  chairs and a plank.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> The  boy, if ever he was, did he survive? Did  he live? &hellip; This question, as <br>
  it  happens, is a question that confronts our philosopher in a book from the <br>
  thirteenth  century, a book called <em>Prognostica Socratis basilei</em>.  The <br>
  philosopher  found it one day in Oxford, in the Bodleian Library. It is a <br>
  fortune-telling  book that includes thirty-six questions, and each time you <br>
  open  the book you are invited to choose one.  I do not know why, but the <br>
  philosopher  chose:<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br><em>Si puer vivet</em> &ndash; &lsquo;If the boy lives.&rsquo; <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br>The same ancient book includes the answer to this question, but the <br>
  philosopher  is not letting on. To find the answer you  must, therefore, <br>
  take  the last train to Oxford, to that -<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:  <br>Labyrinth between the&hellip;colleges. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br>And, once there, you must follow the philosopher to the dead centre of  the <br>
  labyrinth, to somewhere they call the Duke  Humfrey Room.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> Are you following? <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Perhaps not, but you should. You  owe it to a boy, and perhaps even to a<br>
  philosopher.  So, listen well as he tells your future: <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>One  day I will be dead, and you will come into the Duke Humfrey <br>
  Room to look for the answer in this book. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The philosopher is now dead. He  died on October the 8th 2004; I <br>
  heard it on the radio, a day later, a day late. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>The  radio transmits, no one understands.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>But I do understand that the philosopher  is dead. It is, then, time for you <br>
  to go into the Bodleian and look for the  answer. First, though, the oath:<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>&lsquo;I,  hereby undertake not to bring into the Library or kindle therein any <br>
  fire or flame.&rsquo; &hellip; <br>&nbsp;<br>
  [BREAK]  &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The  Duke Humfrey Room is an ancient library, shaped by concentration, <br>
  the  concentration of all the knowing world. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>Letters,  knowledge wall them up in their crypt. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br> And it seemed like a crypt on the day I visited the Room,  and there <br>
  met  a very English Frenchman who had emerged, like a holy father, from <br>
  the  latticed confessional box that they call &lsquo;The Reserve.&rsquo; This kindly<br>
  man was an archivist, and explained that it was he  who, twenty-six years <br>
  before,  had assisted the philosopher. He then showed  me what the <br>
  philosopher  had hand-written in a special copy of his book. It read: <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> To  the soul and body of the Bodleian (&lsquo;&agrave; l&rsquo;&acirc;me et au corps de la <br>
  Bodleian&rsquo;). <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>For  some reason, the French archivist had never seen this before, but he <br>
  immediately  got the long-delayed message, the inter-linguistic text. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  ARCHIVIST: <br>I &hellip; <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>He  said<br>&nbsp;<br>
  ARCHIVIST: <br>&hellip;am  the <em>corpse</em> of the Bodleian.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> He is right, there is a stiff in Jacques  Derrida&rsquo;s Bodleian; however, it has <br>
  not  yet been finally identified. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> I  arrived at opening time, just now, still dragging along with me a <br>
  dream:  all around someone in danger of death several doctors. The <br>
  patient  is passive, immobile &hellip; <em>my father</em>. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>If  there is  a body in the Room then, at first glance, it is (the philosopher <br>
  dreams)  -<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> My  father. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br> The philosopher&rsquo;s father had died of cancer  at the age of seventy-four, <br>
  and  one day the philosopher would also die of cancer at seventy-four, in <br>
  hospital. The passive and immobile patient at the centre  of this Oxford <br>
  dream  may, then, be the philosopher himself.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> I intend to go back to Oxford, to take the investigation to its  end. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The  philosopher, I think, investigates his own death. He  has, you see, <br>
  come  to Oxford in order to die - <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> It would be good if I died tonight, in the  college.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The college is Balliol, a place where the  thought of the philosopher&rsquo;s death <br>
  had,  in fact, already been entertained. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>June 6th 1977 - seminar (at Balliol). Afterward, on the lawn, a <br>
  young  student (very handsome) thought he could provoke me and, I think, <br>
  seduce  me by asking why I didn&rsquo;t kill myself. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>If,  two years later, when the philosopher returned to Balliol, he had then <br>
  died  overnight the handsome student may himself have faced some <br>
  awkward  questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  NARRATOR:<br> Cue the great Thomas de Quincey:<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DE Q.: (Grandly)<br> Gentlemen, it is a fact that every philosopher of eminence has <br>
  either  been murdered or at least been very near it, &ndash; insomuch that, if a <br>
  man  calls himself a philosopher and never had his life attempted, rest <br>
  assured  there is nothing in him. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br> Quite  so. A sentiment shared, one feels, by  our philosopher, particularly <br>
  whenever  in Oxford.  But then, where better to be murdered than glorious <br>
  Oxford?  Indeed, where else are you so likely to have your murderer <br>
  identified  than in a city which boasts a host of brilliant detectives? &hellip; <br>
  But,  please, let us not involve the police in our investigation. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br>We&hellip;  must&hellip;  tell the police.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> But  I would really rather not. It shall be  like that novel called <em>Which Way </em><br>
  <em> Came Death?</em>, a 1936 murder-mystery that is set in (of  all places) my <br>
  father&rsquo;s  school. As ever this is true, absolutely  true. The novel revolves <br>
  around  a murder that, in the end, the Headmaster keeps silent. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  HEADMASTER:<br> Death from natural causes is bad for a  school, but, if a suspicion of <br>
  unnatural causes  leaks out, it&rsquo;s &ndash; damnation.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Yes,  let us keep this in-house, in-school, within the academy. Let us see <br>
  what books can tell us, what books might  know, or even fore-know.<br>
  This, perhaps, is madness but if so, it is  shared by the philosopher. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>I will look up what has happened to us in  this book from the 13th <br>
  century.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br> He is, you see, for some reason, certain that  this fragile book -<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:  <br>Secretly recounts our history.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br> And  that is precisely why I must find the fading page that will tell me, <br>
  once  and for all, if the boy lives, <em>Si puer vivet</em>. It is also why I turn, and <br>
  turn,  to this murder-mystery called Which Way Came Death? It  too <br>
  whispers  our history. And what it first whispers  is that the one who <br>
  investigates  murder must himself be a suspect. The  headmaster, <br>
  remember,  chose not to call the police. The  detective must always be a <br>
  suspect. He must even suspect himself&hellip;. My father  certainly suspected <br>
  himself&hellip;<br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br>The  girl &hellip;I had to hold her head.&hellip; They took turns&hellip;. I could not kill <br>
  her.  &hellip;I didn&rsquo;t kill her&hellip;My gun. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>So, which way came  this death? Did my father shoot the girl? Was it his <br>
  gun that killed her? <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> It&rsquo;s a firing squad - someone gives the  order to fire, and everyone goes <br>
  to  it. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> The trouble is, when you&rsquo;re shooting in the  dark it&rsquo;s difficult to know who <br>
  shot  whom. The point is made in the school  magazine, in a report on the <br>
  army  cadet camp of 1947, a camp my father attended.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  SCHOOLBOY: <br>We  had the thrill of night ops on the Saturday.  Blackened faces and <br>
  lowered  voices helped towards realism, but the problem of &ldquo;who shot <br>
  whom&rdquo;  was never solved. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>It  may never be. Not that it matters; I do  realise that these were only <br>
  operations,  that the cadets were only play-shooting.  It&rsquo;s like when, as <br>
  children,  we would go to the fair, and my father would so impress us at the <br>
  shooting-booth  and say that he&rsquo;d learnt to shoot at school.  Fitting, then, <br>
  that  at school he should have played the part of a character called Pistol in <br>
  Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Henry V</em>. That was June 1947, just a couple of months <br>
  before  the cadet camp. &hellip; So, to resume: whom  did Pistol shoot? And if <br>
  it  wasn&rsquo;t Pistol that did the killing, who was it? &hellip; It is, I think, too early <br>
  to  say; but no-one can be ruled out.  Everyone of us is a suspect, <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>Right here I kill you ...there is someone  in me who kills. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:  <br>See, even philosophers are dangerous &hellip; if only by thinking, by using <br>
  their  brains. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br>The brains, kill, quick!...The brains,  kill, quick! <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The  brain, I think, is another unusual suspect.  Let it be noted: thinking <br>
  may not be trusted. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br>Think! Think! &hellip;Think! Think! <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>And think-think is exactly what Socrates does  - <br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>That devil of a Socrates <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Yes, that perverter of youth, that  philosophical celebrant of the beautiful <br>
  boy. Everyone knows that the father of metaphysics  cannot be trusted <br>
  with  boys, or at least not his thinking, his brains, his mind. Indeed, I shall <br>
  here  insist that if philosophy were personified, were Someone (as She so <br>
  often  is), She might well be saying:<br>&nbsp;<br>
  PHILOSOPHY: <br>Hell  is in my father&rsquo;s head. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  [BREAK]&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> &lsquo;Hell  is in my father&rsquo;s head.&rsquo; These are words my own father heard, <br>
  in  Oxford in April 1951, as he sat and watched Christopher  Fry&rsquo;s play <em>A </em><br>
  <em> Sleep of Prisoners</em>. It is  about four British soldiers held in a church turned <br>
  prison  camp. I am not sure why they are  prisoners, or who is holding <br>
  them,  or even where they are, but their hell somehow mirrors the hell that, <br>
  one  day, would be in my father&rsquo;s head. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: <br>Oh, someone take me out&hellip;. A little church&hellip; it was the Sergeant. &hellip; He <br>
  was  wearing uniform. &hellip;In the army. &hellip;Trapped. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>The  boy that was my father is trapped in a church with men who look like <br>
  soldiers. Or so his story goes. If the boy then lives, lives to become a <br>
  young  man who, in 1951, watches a play about soldiers caught <br>
  in  a church, what happens in the young man&rsquo;s head?  Did the play <br>
  awaken  a memory, or create a memory? <br>&nbsp;<br>
  SOLDIER: (from <em>The Sleep of Prisoners</em>)<br> The  boy&rsquo;s dead. You might as well be told: I  say, the <br>
  boy&rsquo;s  dead.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Those words, they are from the play. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER-AS-UNDERGRAD: (calm, earnest  1950s Oxford voice)<br> My dear Mary, last night I saw <br>
  Fry&rsquo;s  <em>The Sleep of Prisoners</em>, a very fine drama though I found it rather <br>
  hard  to get hold of the meaning and the moral. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>But think, father! think! Is not the meaning and moral what you suffered <br>
  as  a boy, whilst away at school? Don&rsquo;t you recall - the church? the <br>
  soldiers?  being trapped? <br>
  (Silence)<br>
  No, he is not listening, for  April 1951 is not a time to look back. This  is <br>
  Oxford in springtime and he is in love. His letters speak of playing<br>
  canasta like the smart set, of chasing the  college eight on the river, and singing madrigals from<br> 
  a punt.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA: <br>&lsquo;Madrigal&rsquo;  - a song with 4,5,6, 7 voices. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> My  father&rsquo;s Oxford letters transcribe, I admit, a dream of Oxford, a dream <br>
  of  Oxford-past. And yet it is also a dream  of Oxford-future. Listen: <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER-AS-UNDERGRAD: (<em>Writing a letter</em>)<br>March 10th 1951. My  dear Mary, Spring at last is here, <br>
  and  somehow I am sure that the summer is  going to be a fine one. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>And  it was. Once Schools are over, Mary will  go up to Oxford for a <br>
  Commemoration  Ball, and that night, at Christ Church, within the Dean&rsquo;s <br>
  Garden,  he will propose to her and they will dance.  The summer is going <br>
  to  be fine, and so too the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  DERRIDA:<br> Promise me that one day there will be a  world.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>Promise?  How could I? But, the young  Oxonian he might make such a promise.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER-AS-UNDERGRAD: (<em>Writing a letter</em>) <br>
  &lsquo;Dear Mary, I am in sympathy with pacifist ideals, and <br>
  indeed  am now a Socialist. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>See.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER-AS-UNDERGRAD: (<em>Writing a letter</em>)<br> However, whatever my politics, it does not seem to make <br>
  our  meat rations any larger.&rsquo;<br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF:<br> War was slow to leave hungry Oxford, but Pistol-the-pacifist will still set <br>
  down  his gun, declaring himself a conscientious objector. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  FATHER: (now an old man, once more)<br> We don&rsquo;t  fight&hellip;. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  <em>Pause</em><br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>In  <em>Henry V</em>,  when Pistol exits stage-right a character simply known as <br>
  &lsquo;Boy&rsquo;  is left, all alone, looking around at the deserted English camp. <br>
  And  he says: <br>&nbsp;<br>
  BOY: <br> There is none to guard it but boys. <br>&nbsp;<br>
  MYSELF: <br>In  1951 there is one boy less to guard camp England.  Not that England <br>
  needs  saving any more; war is finally over, the summer will be fine, so <br>
  too  England.  And my father is sure of this, for his world is one of pure <br>
  prediction,  pure prognostication. In the summer of  1951 his world is the <br>
  world  of the Oxford fortune-telling book. Time then to turn, at last, to<br>
  the page to which the  philosopher points, the page that will reveal if the <br>
  boy  lives, Si puer vivet.  As I turn, though, to  this page from the 13th <br>
  century,  the text before me seems familiar, for it reads like a <br>
  dream,  like something that has somehow come straight from my father, <br>
  the  post-war, pacifist man-boy who was so much in love: <br>&nbsp;<br>
  13th-C BOOK:<br> That  boy will live long in the land&hellip;<br>
  Wars initiated will be rendered peaceful&hellip; <br>
  You  will have good sleep by the side of your heart&rsquo;s desire.<br>
