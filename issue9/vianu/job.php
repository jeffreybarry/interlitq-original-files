            <br><p><strong>Lidia Vianu</strong>: You  were looking for an interview with Michael Hamburger when you stumbled on my  site (<a href="http://www.unibuc.ro/ro/cd_lidvianu_ro" class="link1">http://www.unibuc.ro/ro/cd_lidvianu_ro</a>). Is literature your hobby or your  job?</p>
            <p><strong>Stephen Wilson</strong>:  Hobby seems too small a word. Literature has been an enduring passion. Poetry  is a life-force, a kind of anti-aging growth factor?&nbsp; </p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>.  As a psychiatrist, I should think the human mind has no secrets for you.  Poetry, on the other hand, is a land of all kinds of secrets. Does your  profession help your poetry?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. Psychiatrists  do not know much about the human mind. We know a little about how the brain  functions and psychoanalysis teaches us something about the mind, its  tremendous creative potential and its extraordinary destructive capacity. Its  tendency to&nbsp; self-deception. My  profession helps me to read poetry (including my own ) and poetry helps me to  practise my profession. Both activities can be ways of strengthening one&rsquo;s  ability to come to terms with the truth. T.S. Eliot famously tells us that  humankind cannot bear very much reality, but Emily Dickinson found a way &ndash;  &lsquo;Tell all the truth but tell it slant &ndash; Success in circuit lies.&rsquo; Poetry is  non-discursive language, it is writing which is undetermined by the width of  the page, it is &lsquo;tropological&rsquo;, it is &lsquo;circuit&rsquo;, but it does not hurt. This  does not mean (as Plato would have it) that poetry has to tell lies.  Paradoxically it delivers a shot of truth-tolerating medicine together with a  large dollop of pleasure. </p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>.  Among the poems you have written one mentions a grandmother born in Minsk:</p>
            <p><strong>Chance Encounter With  My Grandmother</strong></p>
            <p>The odds of meeting you on the Nevskiy Prospekt<br>
              must have been verging on a billion to one,<br>
              especially since you were born in Minsk,<br>
              Belarus,  considerably further south than St Petersburg<br>
              more than a hundred and twenty years earlier.<br>
              Yet there you were &ndash; walking toward me<br>
              through the snow, surprisingly sure-footed<br>
              among a mass of bobbing hats and coats. </p>
            <p>Your fur was out of fashion, as were your<br>
              flat-soled boots, and you were carrying<br>
              two shopping bags, one in each hand,<br>
              full of provisions. I saw you glance down <br>
              and tut as you crossed the Anichov   Bridge,<br>
              where beer bottles and empty cans had been <br>
              chucked into the Fontanka, frozen into a carpet <br>
              of snow and ice and slush, littered like the bedroom </p>
            <p>floor of a teenage boy. Opposite the Literary Caf&eacute;,<br>
              where Pushkin, having been dubbed, &ldquo;Grand Master <br>
              of the Most Serene Order of Cuckolds&rdquo;, <br>
              waited for his fatal duel with Georges d&rsquo;Anth&eacute;s, <br>
              we ran right into one another. You seemed deeply<br>
              unimpressed and as I kissed your cheek, warned me <br>
              against poetry, not to get any mesh&uacute;gga ideas,<br>
              or&nbsp; fritter away my  time on a ganze meg&iacute;llah.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              In  Yiddish &lsquo;mesh&uacute;gga&rsquo; means crazy, &lsquo;ganze meg&iacute;llah&rsquo; means, in this context, a long  book with aspirations to literary merit.</p>
            <p>[<em>Fluttering Hands</em> p. 61.]</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<br>
              Does this mean your parents were Russian (or at least one of  them)? You remember going to the Synagogue in London  in 1954:</p>
            <p><strong>Names</strong><br>
              London, 1954</p>
            <p>On Fridays just before sunset,<br>
              mother lit candles for the Sabbath.<br>
              We thanked the King of the Universe<br>
              for the fruit of the vine, the gift<br>
              of bread from the earth, the beauty<br>
              of the day coming in like a bride.<br>
              At sunrise we woke to a stillness,<br>
              washed and reminded ourselves<br>
              there was only one God &ndash;<br>
              begged that our lips be opened,<br>
              our mouths declare His praise.<br>
              Clad in our best for synagogue<br>
              we walked the three-quarter mile,<br>
              my father&rsquo;s trilby, my school-cap<br>
              raised in unison to ladies passing by.<br>
              A silk tallith draped over his shoulders<br>
              like the stole on a ball-gown,<br>
              Rabbi Rabinovitz unfurled the scrolls,<br>
              a silver finger pointing the way &ndash;<br>
              parchment teaming with tiny black fauna, <br>
              each one with a pop-star&rsquo;s quiff: <br>
              ,dal eht otnu  dnah yht htrof hcterts ton oD<br>
  &nbsp;.mih otnu mrah yna uoht od rehtien<br>
              After the service I ran home through<br>
              the playing fields of Gladstone   Park,<br>
              passing ruffians calling &ndash; Jew, Jew-boy.</p>
            <p>[<em>Fluttering  Hands</em> p.62.]</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              This last line, &lsquo;Jew, Jew-boy&rsquo;, reminds me of Harold Pinter,  who had a similar experience as a teenager. Is it comfortable to be a Jewish  Londoner? Are you Jewish or British at this point in your life?</p>
            <p><strong>SW. </strong>&nbsp;My parents were born in the United    Kingdom. My maternal grandmother was born in  Minsk, the daughter of a Hebrew  teacher who fled the city together with his family in the wake of anti-Jewish  pogroms. She was brought up in Kovno, Lithuania  and came to England  at the turn of the nineteenth century where she met my grandfather who had come  from Lvov, part of &lsquo;Jewish&rsquo; Galicia  at that time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now of course, the Ukraine.  They felt free in England.</p>
            <p>By contrast with the violent anti-Semitism they had  experienced, British anti-Semitism was mild, mainly cultural. I was brought up  in an observant Jewish family in London,  but I have not lived in London  since qualifying as a doctor in 1968, nor am I an observant Jew. Britishness  and Jewishness are not exclusive alternatives and both are part of my identity,  neither is easily definable. However, two thousand years of&nbsp; European Christian anti-Semitism cannot be  easily shrugged off. It is embedded in the English language and literature  which I love. This is not conducive to comfort. &nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>. Elaine  Feinstein was a bit apprehensive as far as anti-Semitism was concerned. Michael  Hamburger simply said it was the Germans who made the German Jews Jewish, which  means his parents were very well assimilated in Germany  before he had to leave. Ruth Fainlight is proud of her Jewishness but feels  very British. Dannie Abse seems aloof. You are busy working on an anthology of  Jewish literature in England,  if I am not mistaken. Why? What makes you look for co-nationals while &ndash; if that  is your identity &ndash; you live in a sort of exile?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. I cannot  choose my identity, I experience it as a given. I was raised in a Jewish  Community. My parents spoke English but they could also speak Yiddish. I learnt  and prayed in Hebrew from an early age. I had a Bar Mitzvah when I was  thirteen. My early cultural heroes were secular Jews central to the  intellectual development of the modern world, Marx, Freud, Einstein, Kafka. My  Jewish identity was not primarily formed in reaction to anti-Semitism (although  this is also an inescapable factor). </p>
            <p>&lsquo;Poetics of the Diaspora&rsquo;, which I am working on, is not so  much an anthology as a critical commentary investigating the figurative  structure of Anglo-Jewish poems. I discovered sequences of metaphor in my own  work which seemed to be employed in an unconscious attempt to process  troublesome experience. I wanted to see if other Anglo-Jewish poets used the  same or similar strategies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>.  Why do most Jews prefer to live in the Diaspora?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. In 130  Hadrian visited Judea and ordered the province to be  renamed Palestine. Six years of  Jewish-Roman war followed. In  the year 136 the Romans finally prevailed. From that time onward till the  creation of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the Jewish people ceased to  exist as a political entity and all Jews were considered to be living in the  Diaspora. The demise of the Jews&rsquo; sovereignty  over land combined with the refusal to give up their religion and identity as a  people created two elements in their diasporic existence: an unending  attachment to the Land of Israel, the redemption of Zion as a perpetual  longing; and an unending status as &lsquo;foreigner sojourning in someone else&rsquo;s  land&rsquo;, second-class citizen, eternal &lsquo;other&rsquo;, perpetual scapegoat . So it is only for the last 58 years  that there has been any choice.</p>
            <p>Given full  economic, political and religious freedom, equality of opportunity and freedom  from persecution, given a pluralist liberal-democracy,&nbsp; the disadvantages attached to &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; do  not apply. Under these circumstances, I think most people would prefer to live  in the country where they were born. But these conditions have rarely existed  in Jewish history, sometimes referred to as a &lsquo;lachrymose&rsquo; history. The hopelessness  of satisfactory Jewish life in &lsquo;exile&rsquo; terribly confirmed by the Nazi genocide  of European Jewry was replaced by the hopefulness of the Jewish State set up in  its aftermath. </p>
            <p>It is a tragedy of immense proportion that this has led to  the creation of a new Palestinian Diaspora and seemingly irresolvable conflict.  Jewish nationalism at the end of the nineteenth century was a &nbsp;late development compared to other national  movements. Palestinian nationalism even later. Jews in Israel  are sometimes portrayed as colonialists or neo-colonialists. But their  situation is unique. No colonial power on earth ever &nbsp;dug up its own  history in the land which it colonised. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<strong>LV.</strong> Is it all right for Jews to assimilate to  their host countries to the extent they have done so far? I tend to think of  Bellow as American, Dannie Abse as British, Kafka as Czech, Marx as German, and  so on. I wonder, is Jewishness a nationality or a sense of mere  intellectual/emotional/(sometimes only) religious belonging? And if so, belonging  to what exactly?</p>
            <p><strong>SW. </strong>These questions are unanswerable. No doubt  &lsquo;Jewishness&rsquo; is more than one thing or different things to different people. Zionists  have sometimes castigated diasporic Jews for their supposed&nbsp; chameleon characteristics (See &lsquo;Author  A.B. Yehoshua vexes US Jews&rsquo;, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3246476,00.html" class="link1">http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3246476,00.html</a> ), even suggested that assimilation engenders anti-Semitism. Assimilation  carries with it cultural loss, on the other hand pluralism aspires to cultural  gain. But is it possible? Is the creative hyphen meaningful &ndash; Jewish-American,  Anglo-Jewish, Black-American, Anglo-Irish etc.? There has been a sad loss of  Jewish diasporic languages and culture (they were banned in the early days of  the State of Israel). But there has been a gain in the revivication of the  Hebrew language. Judaism itself discriminates against its men folk by insisting  on a matrilineal definition of &lsquo;belonging&rsquo;. This is a self-defeating policy  which contributes to its own extinction.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>LV</strong>.  Why is it always so awkward for a Jew to adopt another religion or another  country? Jews feel so uncomfortable to say: this is my homeland. They simply  say, I was born in... When they turn Catholic, they are afraid of their  co-nationals as much as of the other Catholics. Why this constant and hard to  account for sense of guilt?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. Betrayal. For  centuries Christianity needed to define itself against the split off &lsquo;bad&rsquo;  otherness of the Jews, to identify the Jewish people as a whole with &lsquo;Judas the  (eponymous) betrayer of Christ&rsquo;, the eternal villain. It is a Jewish poet (who had only ever worshipped in the Church of  England), Michael Hamburger, who writes a poem sympathetic to the plight of  Judas:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No part was harder than his and none  more cruel:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be God&rsquo;s chosen villain in the  absolute play,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast out by friends and enemies,  cast out of self,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hated by all for ever, hating  himself;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the sinuous prophecy might  be fulfilled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wriggle, a viper, down the appointed  path,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dust on his tongue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he was dry and twisted as the  final rope&hellip;</p>
            <p>[See Peter Lawson, <em>Passionate Renewal:Jewish Poetry in </em><em>Britain</em><em> Since 1945</em>, (Nottingham: Five Leaves Publications, 2001) p.109. ]</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It took nearly two millennia  of&nbsp; Christian<strong> </strong>anti-Semitism and the horrors of the Holocaust to elicit, twenty  years after the end of&nbsp; World War II, an  (almost) unequivocal Declaration from Pope Paul VI, <em>Nostra Aetate</em>, to the effect that not all Jews were to be held responsible  for the death of Christ. </p>
            <p>In Christian anti-Semitism (but not the later racist  variety) conversion was seen as a remedy for the Jewish condition. Forced  conversion was a punishment &ndash; Shylock&rsquo;s punishment for his lust after Christian  blood &ndash; without doubt a variant of the &lsquo;Blood Libel&rsquo;. Jews who convert have to  deal with the deeply embedded anti-Semitism in Christianity. They are invited  to betray themselves. If they stay Jewish they are identified with Judas  betraying Christ, if they convert they become Judas betraying the Jews.</p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>. May I ask if you are a religious man? If you cultivate your Jewishness  while you are an important member of British society? Doctor, professor,  writer... What more could you do to prove you are British? Yet... are you?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. I am not a religious man. I do not cultivate my Jewishness anymore  than I cultivate my respiration or my heartbeat. And yes, I am also British, I  do not think about that very much. Britishness is a fairly inclusive category  nowadays. Nobody would ever say: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look British&rsquo;, although they might  say: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look English.&rsquo; Jews are a small minority in this country,  probably 0.5% of a population of 60,000,000. By contrast there are thought to  be about twice as many Afro-Caribbeans and about 1.5 million British Moslems.  About 200,000 Poles are thought to have entered the country since they joined  the EU. Multicultural Britain is a very different place to the  whiter more uniform, more socially stratified Britain into which I was born. &nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>. When did you write your first poem?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. I think I was fifteen or sixteen. It was published in the school  magazine, <em>The Kilburnian</em>. Later I  became its editor. I attended an all boys grammar school in London. There was a synagogue nearby where  Jewish boys could obtain kosher meals. Years after I left, the school became an  Islamic High School for Girls and the synagogue is now a mosque. </p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>. Did you continue writing poetry or  is it a recent development in your life?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. I wrote poems sporadically over the following years. The fact that I did so seemed to threaten my career in  medicine before it had even begun. It was only after several rejections from  London Medical Schools that I ended up at the Royal   Free Hospital  in 1962, then almost all female, being interviewed by a Welsh Dean who shared  my enthusiasm for Dylan Thomas and did not regard it as a disqualification. Yet  there is a noble tradition of medical poets. Apollo himself was said to know  &lsquo;three arts&rsquo; &ndash; music, poetry and medicine.</p>
            <p>About sixteen years ago I began to publish occasional poems  in magazines but it is only during the last couple of years that I have devoted  half my week to poetry and the other half to psychiatry. Dannie Abse knew he  had to do this when he was a young doctor, it took me rather longer to get to  the same point. Now I&rsquo;m a man in a hurry. </p>
            <p><strong>LV.</strong><strong> </strong>Some say poetry is a young man&rsquo;s  prerogative, meaning there is no poetry without love in it.&nbsp; Great poets have always managed to combine  thought and feeling in a passionate love for ideas. How do you write? What  produces the poem, in your case? Could it have anything to do with that Jewish  sensibility that is like a fine lace?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. Well I don&rsquo;t  think love is a young man&rsquo;s prerogative. But poetry is words, stuff, linguistic  material through which the emotions are &lsquo;given a local habitation&rsquo;. My poems  tend to be derived from experience which is then filtered through the  associative (holophrastic) process that language allows. &nbsp;My sense is that all forms of&nbsp; love including passionate love can&nbsp; grow with age. My poem, &lsquo;Eva&rsquo;, is a love-poem,  an unrequited lover&rsquo;s poem to my granddaughter:</p>
            <p><strong>Eva </strong><br>
              <em>at fifteen months</em></p>
            <p>The way your small head turns,<br>
              you could be networking<br>
              at a cocktail party or a waitress <br>
              trying not to catch my eye, <br>
              a barmaid serving someone else&mdash;<br>
              worse, a lone woman waiting <br>
              for the last tube. I want to tell you,<br>
              once, during a bomb scare,<br>
              I received an unexpected parcel<br>
              wrapped in plain brown paper,<br>
              which turned out to contain<br>
              a&nbsp; single orchid,  whose stem<br>
              was immersed in a crystal<br>
              scent bottle, filled with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>[<em>Fluttering  Hands</em> p. 47.]</p>

            <p><strong>LV</strong>.  Is poetry a good form of psychotherapy? When you are strong on paper, you can  at least hope you are so in real life, too. Can poetry make us happier?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. One of  Plato&rsquo;s objections to poetry was that it would subvert young men&rsquo;s courage by  giving expression to emotions, to &lsquo;weakness&rsquo;. Shelley, however, believed that poetry had a  transformative effect upon the emotions, an enabling function which allowed us  to take in &lsquo;the poisonous waters that flow from death through life and in a  secret alchemy convert them to &lsquo;potable gold&rsquo; &ndash;&nbsp;  in other words &lsquo;to metabolise&rsquo; mental pain. </p>
            <p>Nowadays we  have &lsquo;Poets in Residence&rsquo; in mental hospitals and prisons as well as arts  centres and universities but editors of magazines and judges of poetry  competitions sometimes warn against submitting &lsquo;therapy&rsquo; by which I suppose  they mean poems which have only personal value. </p>
            <p>I believe that  a series of poetic tropes may not only express emotional conflict but also be capable  of modulating its unconscious roots. Poetry can help us to resolve conflict,  poetry can help us to bear pain and poetry can give us pleasure. Yes, I am  convinced that poetry can make us happier.</p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>.  I wonder about the fate of poetry in the near future sometime. Today poets read  poets (or interviewers read them...). Do we have an audience of amateurs any  more? I have this certainty in the back of my mind that Homer was the answer to  an archetypal human need which cannot die. Poetry should never go away. But how  will it survive?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. There are  probably more &lsquo;closet poets&rsquo; than published poets. Writing poetry is an act of  self-expression so intimate that many perform it in secret. When Emily  Dickinson died in 1886, her sister Lavinia discovered about 1800 poems locked  in a silver box, gathered together in sixty packets of loosely-sewn-together  paper. But you are asking who will <em>read</em> poetry and this is a different question. I agree that the reading of poetry  also answers a basic human need and am optimistic about its future. Poetry is  as unlikely to die out as song.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p><strong>LV</strong>.  And one last question (I have abused your kindness as it is &ndash; but talking to a  psychiatrist poet is so rare and so insightful): It used to be essential to a  poet to be read and published and sold everywhere. Byron was a myth. The poet  today is so private and just part of&nbsp; a  small, very specialized community. I have constantly found it easy to deal with  poets, who are always so warm and reassuring, while novelists whom I approach  with interviews will hardly give me the time of day (with the exception of  David Lodge, Peter Ackroyd, Graham Swift, Julian Barnes and Alasdair Gray). I  am aware time is limited and they are cornered from all sides. But so are you:  practicising medicine, teaching, a full-time grandparent, poet and (I am sure)  a great reader. You had time to look for poetry on the internet, and you took  time to answer these questions. Kazuo Ishiguro never once answered the five  letters I sent him over the years. Has poetry changed &ndash; socially &ndash; into  something new? Could you define the &lsquo;use and function of poetry&rsquo; nowadays?</p>
            <p><strong>SW</strong>. Language can be put to good or bad use. Poetry can be  meaningfully contrasted with propaganda. I think the social function of poetry  is to make us more human, that of propaganda to make us less so. Poetry, like  serious fiction, masquerades as &lsquo;lies&rsquo; but promotes the truth, propaganda  masquerades as the truth but it pedals lies.</p>
