            <p>This anthology of poems is a celebration  of multilingualism and diversity. It consists of ninety-three poems in  ninety-three contemporary languages. Each of these poems is a version of a  single poem. That is to say, ninety-two of them are translations. All,  including the English source-poem, entitled &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;, are presented in the English  alphabetical order of their named languages. </p>
            <p>The  source-poem itself incorporates interlingual and cross-cultural elements.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> Set in Greece,  it embeds references to Modern Greek language, literature, landscape and  culture.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> Both the source poem and the anthology that has emerged from it are dedicated  to the memory of George Seferis (1900-1971).</p>
            <p>The  languages represented in the anthology are indigenous to many parts of Asia,  Africa,  Europe  and the Mediterranean.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a> As the biographies of the author-translators make clear, a large number of  these languages are spoken in other parts of the world too. The geographical  mobility of these languages is explored in more detail in <strong>Notes</strong> <strong>[1]</strong> in the <strong>Afterwords</strong> below.&nbsp; </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">2.</strong></p>
            <p>No  qualitative distinction is made in this anthology between what are often and  wrongly described as &lsquo;major&rsquo; or &lsquo;minor&rsquo; languages. Languages with small numbers  of speakers are listed alongside those with large numbers and are recognised as  having equal status, depth, dignity and importance.</p>
            <p>For  similar reasons, the word &lsquo;dialect&rsquo; has been deliberately avoided, except in  this paragraph. While this term implies all sorts of pejorative connotations  that are familiar to everybody, varying from provincialism and quaintness to a  sort of retrograde and even culpable inferiority, there have never been any  universally agreed or adequate criteria, at least on linguistic grounds, to  differentiate a dialect and a language. The aphorism attributed to the Yiddish  linguist, historian, scholar and anti-fascist Max Weinreich appears conclusive:  &ldquo;a language is a dialect with an army and navy&rdquo;: <em>a shprakh iz a dialekt mit  an armey un flot</em>. <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a></p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">3.</strong></p>
            <p>The  making of this anthology has been marked by enthusiasm, hospitality and  generosity.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> The speed with which the idea has caught on whenever it has been presented has  been one of the most striking features of the project and, along with it, the  readiness of contributors to help, advise, and suggest other participants.  While the credit for speed of course is due partly to email, language is  everybody&rsquo;s business, and not only poets, translators, scholars and linguists  have come forward, but people working in many other fields. All of which has  meant that putting this anthology together has been a fascinating and rewarding  experience, especially in discovering more about each individual language, as  well as in exploring the further potential and deeper implications of email and  the Internet for poetry and poetics. The names of some of those who have been  involved in aspects additional to actual translation are given in the <strong>Acknowledgements</strong> section in the <strong>Afterwords</strong>.</p>
            <p>Even  in this anthology&rsquo;s current version, many more than ninety-two languages  could have been included. Nor does this number indicate final closure of the &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;  project but merely the total versions that have been achieved since the idea  was first broached to Peter Robertson, editor of the <em>International Literary  Quarterly</em>, on December   5, 2008 &ndash; an idea that he welcomed generously.  He agreed to allow ten months for the  collation, editing and publishing of this  preliminary collection. Since then, the project has continued across three issues, numbers 9, 10 and 11. For the project&rsquo;s next phase, see the notes on <strong>Continuation of the &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; Project</strong> in the <strong>Afterwords</strong>. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">4.</strong></p>
            <p>The title &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;  itself comes from Modern Greek. The noun <em>&beta;&#972;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;</em> is a noun meaning &lsquo;turn&rsquo;  and also &lsquo;walk&rsquo;, &lsquo;stroll&rsquo;. The Greek expression <em>&pi;&#940;&mu;&epsilon;</em> <em>&beta;&#972;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;</em> [<em>pame </em><em>volta</em>]  means literally *<em>let&rsquo;s go a turn</em>,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> i.e. &lsquo;let&rsquo;s take a turn,&rsquo; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s go  for a walk/ stroll,&rsquo; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s stretch our legs.&rsquo; The word <em>&beta;&#972;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;</em> is also used to mean,  more precisely, &lsquo;evening  promenade&rsquo;, <em>&beta;&rho;&alpha;&delta;&iota;&nu;&#942;</em><em> &beta;&#972;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;</em> [<em>vrathini </em><em>volta</em>].  The custom of the evening promenade is expressed in Italian by the word <em>passeggiata</em> and in Serbian, Czech and Slovak by the common word <em>korzo</em>. During  certain hours of the early evening, around dusk, everyone in the town who might  feel like going for a walk takes a saunter or stroll up and down the main  street. The custom used to exist in widely different cultures, including  for example, in Portugal.  A version of it exists among Jewish communities on  the Sabbath.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a></p>
            <p>The  idea of &lsquo;turning&rsquo; is embedded in the Modern Greek word and usage: <em>&beta;&#972;&lambda;&tau;&alpha; </em>is  a word of Latin origin (<em>volgere</em>, to turn). So a <em>volta</em> in this sense is a &lsquo;turn&rsquo;, up and down and back again, in the pleasurable  presence of an indeterminate number of other people who, for whatever reasons  of their own, happen to be engaged in the same activity. The word <em>volta</em> also exists in Catalan, Galician and Portuguese, and is cognate with Spanish <em>vuelta</em>.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a> In all these Romance languages the word has the primary idea of &lsquo;turn&rsquo;,  &lsquo;return&rsquo;, and more or less the same idiomatic meaning of &lsquo;taking a turn&rsquo; as in  Greek.</p>
            <p>Since  the words <em>passeggiata</em> and <em>korzo</em> derive from Latin too, I can&rsquo;t  help wondering if the custom of walking up and down for pleasurable relaxation  started with the ancient Romans, or whether it was assimilated into Latin from  practice among various other cultures. My guess is that it was pre-Roman,  possibly even Neolithic, and widespread in the warm climates around the Mediterranean.  It certainly has a Mediterranean &lsquo;feel&rsquo; to it. </p>
            <p>So  the setting and take-off point for the poem &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;  is an evening walk, a promenade, in a Greek seaside town, as the sun is setting  on the horizon. That is: a self-turning, as day is turning into night and as  light is evening itself out into darkness.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="burnsred">5.</strong></p>
            <p><em>This text is both an introduction to the &lsquo;</em><em>Volta</em><em>&rsquo; project and an exploration of some questions concerning the  processes of poetic translation and composition that the project itself raises. To move more quickly to the ‘Volta’ project, please scroll down to <strong>Section 21</strong>. To consider aspects of the translation and composition process, please continue below. </em></p>
            <p>The  act of poetic translation too is a &lsquo;volta&rsquo;.  And translation involves a turning that is at least double, for it consists of  both a return and a departure. </p>
            <p>The  turning that occurs in the making of a translation necessarily involves a  return to the text that is the translation&rsquo;s source, its point of origin, in  another, known language. And that turning is also equally necessarily a  departure, from that other language towards and into the language of  delivery.&nbsp; So translating also involves  and embodies a turning that is at once a returning, a transversion, a  self-turning. Indeed, translating posits an entire series of complex mental and  linguistic self-turnings.</p>
            <p>In  English, fortunately, <em>turn</em> is a transitive verb too: one can <em>turn</em> one thing into another. Translation is in this sense a reforming and a  transformation, as well as importing its own simultaneous transference and  transmission. The making of a translation necessitates a recursive (i.e.  repetitive and iterative) activity, though not a tautological one: that is to  say, it is a making in which the maker constantly turns and returns to the  originary text and to each and all of its constituents, throughout every stage  of the making of the text in the language of delivery.</p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">6.</strong></p>
            <p>Making  a translation is both the offering of a gift and its reciprocation, a double  hospitality. It involves guardianship and interchange, propriety and trade,  commerce and ownership, negotiation and resolution, pride and sense of identity  in recognition of what is one&rsquo;s own, and curiosity, attraction, desire and even  love for what is strange, foreign, other. I call the condition of this  &lsquo;strange, foreign, other&rsquo; entity <em>elseness</em>.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> Translation entails the enormous pleasure of generosity in giving and sharing  (returning) gifts out of one&rsquo;s own language, while or after reciprocally  receiving the surprising, delightful gift of what is contained in another  language, another culture, another way of thinking, another way of being and  behaving in the world.</p>
            <p>That  is to say translation involves the double pleasure of both <em>thisness</em> and <em>elseness</em>, of a balance, accord, harmony  between the known and understood, on the one hand, and, on the other, what is  only partially known or unknown, understood fragmentarily or not at all.  Translation celebrates and rejoices in both what does and what does not belong  at home.</p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">7.</strong></p>
            <p>Translators,  wherever they happen to live, inhabit border/lines. Translators are  edge-people, bridge-makers. Translation is edge-action, frontier-culture,  margin-work. And the border/lines that a translator constantly criss-crosses  and transgresses, the shifting zones over and through which a translator  zigzags, are located in the mind. The contours and colorations that a  translator discerns in zones of mentation are mapped on both exterior and  interior listening and observation; and the internal listening and observation  are predicated in memory, emotion and intuition. Furthermore, the spaces the  translator finds and opens in those zones, and the patterns the translator  makes in them, are not just linguistic. For the translator&rsquo;s (or translating  team&rsquo;s) necessary bilingualism itself means that the spaces in those zones are  interlingual, infra-lingual, even metalingual. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">8. </strong></p>
            <p>Every  translation obviously has an objective external origin in the sense that it  derives historically from a specific source-text in another language, the  &lsquo;original text&rsquo; or, more precisely, &lsquo;originary text&rsquo;. But a listener or reader  in the language of delivery (&lsquo;target language&rsquo;) might not be in the slightest  bit interested in that knowledge, or for that matter, find it in any way  relevant to the act of reading or listening. In responding to an effective translation,  a listener or reader might be entirely ignorant of ideas like &lsquo;source language&rsquo;  and &lsquo;target language&rsquo;, or else be quite happy to dispense with them.</p>
            <p>This  is to say: the question whether a poetic translation <em>works</em> in the  language of its delivery is one that needs to be asked and answered without  reference to any other language. A translation of quality, even if it is or  contains a mistranslation, exists in its own  right and will lead its own rich life as an original work <em>in its own  language</em>. As for a reader&rsquo;s or listener&rsquo;s response to a literary  translation, above all that of a poem, the irreducible test of quality is that  the text should be experienced <em>as made</em> &ndash; or at least, <em>as if made</em> &ndash; originally in the language in which it is read or heard (i.e. experienced).  Anything less than this cannot involve more than &ldquo;catching the sense at two  removes&rdquo;. <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a></p>
            <p>Therefore,  as far as delivery is concerned, the translator is neither a postman nor a  midwife, honourable and necessary though both such roles are.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> The translator has authority in the genuine and real sense that he or she  becomes the genuine and real author or, at least, co-author of the delivered  text. </p>
            <p>To  state this point of view is of course neither to discount nor to minimise the  parallel need on the part of the translator to be loyal to the originary text.  That pre-requirement is not in question here. Working on the border between  language A and language B, the translator necessarily has double though  (hopefully) not divided loyalties. A balancing act is required: as if the  translator&rsquo;s bilingualism posited a kind of dual citizenship.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a></p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">9. </strong></p>
            <p>In  her essay &lsquo;Foreign in our own country&rsquo; in this issue of the <em>International  Literary Quarterly</em> (see note 2), Maria Filippakopoulou makes comments that  throw light on this discussion from an unusual angle. As a specialist in  theories of literary translation and as a bilingual Greek and English reader,  she explores interlingual patterns in the Greek translation by Ilias Layios of  a series of poems by an English-speaking poet. Here  are three observations from the part of her text that develops out of  discussion of a particular word-choice in Layios&rsquo;s translation:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>In the indefinable period of time  elapsed between the English and the Greek texts, the English adjective has  evolved to become, in the Greek translation, a fully grown up, a syntactically  independent noun.</p>
              <p>I  cannot imagine any bilingual reader of this collection who would not be drawn  to his [Layios&rsquo;s] translations to the detriment of the English poems.</p>
              <p>[I]n the reading experience I am describing, this  &lsquo;original&rsquo; emerges re-energised, transformed: and so much so that [&hellip;] the  English now illuminates the meaning of the <em>Greek</em>. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>To  the credit of Ilias Layios, a poet in his own right, Filippakopoluou finds the Greek  version richer in texture and feeling, and altogether more echoic, resonant and  immediate, than the English &lsquo;original&rsquo; from which it derives. However, the  reading she arrives at indicates considerably more than this response; for in  stating, almost paradoxically, that the <em>prior</em> English version may be  read as a kind of gloss on the subsequent (and consequent) Greek, she almost  arrives at the Borgesian point of implying that the &lsquo;original&rsquo; itself is  readable as a kind of &lsquo;copy of a copy&rsquo;.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a></p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">10.</strong></p>
            <p>As  has already been recognised, objectively and historically, a translation cannot  fail to be a &lsquo;copy&rsquo; of an &lsquo;original&rsquo; text. But Filippakopoulou&rsquo;s fascinating,  nuanced response here shows that, subjectively and experientally, it may be  equally valid to consider a translation itself as a <em>primary</em> text. </p>
            <p>Even  so, even if only in degrees, tiers or layers of abstraction, clearly a  difference is posited in comparing an &lsquo;original&rsquo; poem in one language and a <em>version</em> of a poem, whether in that same language or another.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><sup>14</sup></a> For, the word <em>version</em> inevitably implies a performative or  representational theory by invoking the possibility of other alternative  versions, which may be equally valid (as) performances or representations. </p>
            <p>However,  the logic playing subtly along and across Filippakoulou&rsquo;s analysis also  necessarily implies, first, that the &lsquo;original&rsquo; may be read as a kind of copy  or version <em>of itself</em>, and second, that it is equally possible to regard  the acts both of poetic composition and of poetic translation as representations  or performances of some kind of originary text, the word &lsquo;originary&rsquo; being  considered here in a prototypical or archetypal sense.</p>
            <p>In  this connection, another observation in Filippakopoulou&rsquo;s essay &ndash; taken,  admittedly, out of context &ndash; yields further fascinating speculations:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>One even wonders here whether English, or indeed any  other <em>single</em> language, is capable of fully illustrating the obvious  truth of the poet&rsquo;s insight. Might then a cross-lingual  dialogue not be more suited to the task?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">11. </strong></p>
            <p>To  put these motifs through yet another filter, the obvious objective fact that a  poetic translation is predicated on (based on, derived from) a text already  written in another language yields two further conjectures. First, that <em>any</em> poetic composition is predicated on (based on, derived from) a &lsquo;text&rsquo; that has  not (or not yet) been written in any language. And, second, that such an <em>ur-text</em>,  if it could be said to exist at all, cannot do so meaningfully in a simply  linear or progressive diachronic time-frame, but only in an imaginal,  metalingual condition in which temporal sequence and causation are of little or  no consequence. </p>
            <p>Are  all the versions of &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;,  then, including its originary occurrence in English, thinkable as some kind of  representation or performance of an <em>ur-text</em> &ndash; that is, one that can only  be <em>virtual</em>? This is at least a possible conclusion if we develop  Filippakopoulou&rsquo;s patterns of thinking. </p>
            <p>To  suggest such a way of conceiving literary composition itself is not necessarily  merely to parrot &ndash; and still less to parody &ndash; either conventional Platonic  ideas or theories of <em>mimesis</em> according to, say, Auerbach, the latter  with roots evidently planted in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Poetics</em>.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><sup>15</sup></a> Nor need such a suggestion imply the introduction of that distorting  mirror-image of causality, teleology, as a guiding principle &ndash; a procedure  which would seem, at least to this author, a highly unreliable if not  altogether suspect way of attempting to elucidate patterns among events and to  extract meaningfulness from them.</p>
            <p>Indeed,  rather than applying any such simple two-tier models of causation and  derivation from an anterior or posterior level of &lsquo;reality&rsquo; that might arguably  lurk &lsquo;beneath&rsquo;, &lsquo;above&rsquo; or &lsquo;behind&rsquo; the genesis of a text, an alternative and  possibly more interesting, elegant and intellectually satisfying set of  guidelines for thinking this issue through is indeed <em>thinkable</em>. And this  is one that tallies with Filippakopoulou&rsquo;s lines of enquiry. It is explored in  Section 14 below. But first, some other  considerations.<br>
              <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
              <strong class="burnsred">12. </strong></p>
            <p>Languages  have gaps and holes. The experience of these may be of an oscillation between  language and a &lsquo;zone&rsquo; of &lsquo;non-language&rsquo; which, curiously, still seems somehow  to belong or pertain to the domain of language itself &ndash; perhaps as &lsquo;meta-language&rsquo;  or &lsquo;infra-language&rsquo;. </p>
            <p>In  attempting any description of this kind of experience, it is hard if not  impossible to avoid spatial and temporal (locational) metaphors. The &ldquo;gaps and  holes&rdquo; seem capable of appearing &lsquo;in&rsquo; and &lsquo;around&rsquo; language itself, &lsquo;under&rsquo; and  &lsquo;above&rsquo; language, and &lsquo;between&rsquo; languages&rsquo;. That is to say: the &ldquo;gaps and  holes&rdquo; seem to belong or pertain to <em>all</em> of language&rsquo;s edges, which of  course exist anywhere and everywhere, and at all and any times.</p>
            <p>This  kind of oscillation is not only recognizable but inevitable in certain phases  of poetic composition. At such times, language&rsquo;s presence both in and around  the poet is experienced as volatile, wavering and nebulous, and one&rsquo;s hold on  it, fragile, tenuous and insecure. It is as if language itself clouds over,  smudges, blurs &ndash; or as if it retracts into itself, or stubbornly withdraws to a  temporarily unyielding distance. The poet&rsquo;s passage into, through and out of  language seems uncertain and precarious: a voyage of risk, surprise and possible  discovery. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">13. </strong></p>
            <p>A  comparable though not identical sense of oscillation in and out of language is  evident when a person goes to live in a new speech-community and learns a new  language by being intensively exposed to it. And in such a situation, when the  goal is attainment of at least some degree of bilingualism, another factor  comes into play. For the sense of oscillation from language to &lsquo;non-language&rsquo;  and back again is intersected by the border/line that demarcates the new  language that is being learned and the speaker&rsquo;s already known language. </p>
            <p>An  almost identical set of disorientations occurs during the making of a poetic  translation. The oscillation between language and &lsquo;non-language&rsquo; occurs in the  mind of the translator just as it does in that of any monolingual speaker. But  since the translator (or translating team) already functions effectively in two  or more languages, a translator is probably even more aware than a monolingual  speaker of the fact that languages are neither perfect nor symmetrical in their  command (covering, handling, representation) of reality, and that the lack of  fit between source and target languages means that each particular process of  translation, being context-bound, is new and different. And if translation of a  relatively simple (&lsquo;literal&rsquo;) statement in everyday conversation is already  complex, then how much more so is any expression in a poem, which is likely to  rely on polysemy, as well as a whole range of other familiar effects (e.g.  sound-patternings of one kind or another), in order to achieve its woven  quality? </p>
            <p>For  any translator, the border/line between any two languages is movable, full of  uncertainties and ambiguities, and in need of constant renegotiation,  reclarification and redefinition. For the translator of a poem, the task is  even more complex, for the goal of translation itself can never be merely that  of producing a &lsquo;literal&rsquo; representation that is as close as possible to the  originary text, but rather that of making of a new text that will itself serve  as &lsquo;primary&rsquo;.&nbsp; (See section 10 above.)</p>
            <p>Since  all actual languages inevitably have an imperfect grasp on reality, is it not  possible, then, that some parts of the processes of poetic composition and  poetic translation are performed through &ldquo;gaps and holes&rdquo; in the language (or  languages) that one happens to be thinking and working in &ndash; when, even if only  momentarily, and perhaps unexpectedly, one lurches, pitches or jumps through  such gaps and holes &ndash; and finds oneself somehow &lsquo;outside&rsquo; language, whether on  the border/line of language itself and &lsquo;non-language&rsquo;, or at the margins or  edges between two or more actual languages? </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">14.</strong></p>
           
              <p>In  a critique of the notions of &lsquo;minor&rsquo; and &lsquo;major&rsquo; languages (which is itself  pertinent to the &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; project in more ways than one), Deleuze and Guattari  throw out an observation, almost as an aside, that is strikingly relevant to  these questions, even if not a full answer to them:
                
 <blockquote>                
                Pasolini  demonstrated that the essential thing [&hellip;] is to be found neither in language A,  nor in language B, but in language X, which is none other than language A in  the actual process of becoming language B.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This  statement by the Italian poet and film-director is highly suggestive. In the  opening move of a response exploring its potential, it might for example be  proposed that &lsquo;language X&rsquo; may be precisely &lsquo;where&rsquo; an originary text first  exists (as <em>ur</em>-text); and a poem may be no more nor less than a rendering  of a text from &lsquo;language X&rsquo;. </p>
            <p>However,  immediately qualifying any such preliminary view, the possibility that language  X might be considered an <em>ur-language</em> is denied, because Pasolini  characterises language X as being&nbsp; &ldquo;none  other than&rdquo; ... &ldquo;the <em>actual process</em>&rdquo; of one language &ldquo;<em>becoming</em>&rdquo;  another. Thus language X is not conceivable as any kind of entity that could  have a shape, body, form, etc. Nor is language X thinkable as a &lsquo;locational  zone&rsquo; in the sense of having any existence <em>per se</em>. Rather, language X  occurs <em>only </em>relationally, along the border/line of languages A and B. </p>
            <p>In  Pasolini&rsquo;s statement, then, language X is not <em>anterior</em> to language A or  B but must be either identified with the <em>process of translation itself</em> or a &lsquo;quality&rsquo; inherent in translation. Furthermore, the word &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; embeds  two connected ideas: first, that &lsquo;language X is a <em>newly engendered</em> phenomenon implicit in translation, i.e. in the very fact of the meeting of  languages A and B, on and at their border/line; and second, that it is dynamic  &ndash; a process not a state.</p>
            <p>In  this respect then, Pasolini&rsquo;s &lsquo;language X&rsquo; tallies neatly with the &ldquo;cross-lingual dialogue&rdquo; that  Filippakopoulou hints is more &ldquo;suited&rdquo; to &ldquo;the poet&rsquo;s task&rdquo;. It is  also consonant  with the experience  of&nbsp; the &ldquo;gaps and holes&rdquo; noted above,  which sometimes occurs to a speaker, whether in and around language or between  languages. </p>
            <p>Perhaps,  therefore, &lsquo;language X&rsquo; can be thought (imaged, imagined)as a  dynamic, transformative principle in itself and, <em>inter alia</em>, as a kind  of tension inherent in the act and process of translation. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">15. </strong></p>
            <p>This  limited preliminary sketch of some of the possible implications of Pasolini&rsquo;s  formulation obviously needs fuller exploration, examination and clarification.  But what is clear even from this initial extrapolation of it is that, as a  model for the process of translation, it necessarily involves the <em>oscillation</em> between languages A and B &ndash; and also between &lsquo;actual language&rsquo; and  &lsquo;non-language&rsquo; &ndash; already discussed above. </p>
            <p>Furthermore,  this double movement, forward and back, necessarily involves both recursion (or  iterativeness) and cumulativeness (or accrescence) in the act and process of  the making of <em>any</em> poetic composition, including a translation: on the  one hand, a recursion that itself constantly self-derives both from each of the  composition&rsquo;s separable constituents and from the entirety of the composition  itself; and, on the other, a cumulativeness that itself engenders further  complexities through proliferation and ramification. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">16.</strong></p>
            <p>As  far as physical geography is concerned, the &lsquo;zones&rsquo; a literary translator works  in are no more bound or bounded spatially than they are temporally. </p>
            <p>The  translator works anywhere, simply because two-way entry/exit points between any  two languages are not determined by or dependent on either place or time. The  act and process of translation can occur equally effectively and satisfactorily  in the bastions and citadels of this or that metropolis and at any point on  national frontier-lines &ndash; or for that matter anywhere between them and, indeed,  outside them. </p>
            <p>This  is to say: the interlingual (and/or infra-lingual and/or metalingual) spaces  that a translator has to cross in order to make a translation are mental <em>no  man&rsquo;s lands</em>. And no man&rsquo;s lands by definition belong not merely to  nobody-in-particular but to anybody, to everybody. A no man&rsquo;s land is unnamed,  unnameable and without its own language. Or rather, the language of this or  that no man&rsquo;s land is no more or less than &lsquo;language X&rsquo; &ndash; again, in the terms  of Pier Paolo Pasolini&rsquo;s statement: &ldquo;language A <em>in the actual process of  becoming</em> language B&rdquo; (italics mine &ndash; RB).&nbsp; </p>
            <p>What  is more, the border/line of a no man&rsquo;s land may not even be located in a land  at all but in or across a river; or, for that matter, a sea, where, for  example, a <em>sleeve</em> (<em>manche</em>) can turn into a <em>channel</em>, and  vice-versa, as between Calais and Dover, depending only on which linguistic  terrain one is approaching the coastline from. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">17. </strong></p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">An excursus on coastlines</strong></p>
            <p>Coasts,  at waves&rsquo; edges, are palpable borders. Representations of coasts on maps mark  border/lines. As we know from Euclidian geometry, a straight line has infinite  length and no thickness, which means that &ldquo;the area and the volume of a  straight line are zero.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><sup>17</sup></a> But if we consider the geographical features of coasts, with their innumerable  bays, inlets, cliffs and promontories, first it is evident that no actual  coastlines are ever straight; and, second, common sense indicates that they  apparently have finite lengths. However, as the founder of fractal theory,  Benoit B. Mandelbrot clarifies:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>[T]he  typical coastline is irregular and winding, and there is no question it is much  longer than the straight line between its end points. </p>
              <p>There  are various ways of evaluating its length more accurately [&hellip;] The result is  most peculiar: coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips  between the fingers of one who wants to grasp it. All measurement methods  ultimately lead to the conclusion that the typical coastline&rsquo;s length is very  large and so ill determined that it is best considered infinite.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Mandelbrot&rsquo;s  fractal geometry goes on to show that the measurement of a length of any  particular coastline depends on the scale used for its mapping measurement. </p>
            <p>A  further observation may be added to Mandelbrot&rsquo;s mathematical explorations of  the properties of geographical coastlines. By definition, coastlines are edges,  without thickness or volume, between lands and waters. But since waters move,  these edges move too. Coastal waters, whether of lakes or seas, are pulled by  tides. So real coastlines are never still, even for a nanosecond.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><sup>19</sup></a> On the length of coastlines, Mandelbrot writes:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>In  one manner or another, the concept of geographic length is not as inoffensive  as it seems. It is not entirely &lsquo;objective&rsquo;. The observer intervenes in its  definition.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><sup>20</sup></a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>These  reservations about the length of coastlines apply equally to their <em>position</em>.  The fact that their edges change with each wave means that, unless arbitrarily  averaged time-units are selected and applied, any fine, finite and final  definition or measurement of their position is literally impossible. </p>
            <p align="right"><strong class="burnsred">End of coastlines excursus</strong></p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">18.</strong></p>
            <p>A  translator may work <em>at any point</em> along and around the actual edge  (hedge, ledge) of a language border/line. And, there, language X is no more nor  less than that wavering, continuous, unbroken, and to all intents and purposes,  infinite, border/line itself, which has no area and no volume. </p>
            <p>For  all these reasons, then, the &lsquo;space&rsquo; in which a poetic translator works, and  the nature of that work itself, is <em>deterritorialised</em>. Or, one might say,  it is &lsquo;extraterritorial&rsquo;, in the sense explored by George Steiner.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><sup>21</sup></a> And this point returns our theme again to gift-giving and hospitality. In the  mental and linguistic &lsquo;zones&rsquo; in which an act of poetic translation is  processed (or, it could equally be said, in which the process of translation is  enacted), one cannot be sure who is giver and who is recipient of the poem, the  author of the source-poem or the translator who is its author (or co-author) in  the language of its delivery. </p>
            <p>And  since the giving and receiving of any gift involve not only the reciprocity of  generosity but also of hospitality, in a translation the demarcation between  guest and host is also equivocal. In poetic translation, the host is hosted by  the guest and vice-versa. These roles blur and merge to the point where there  may be no distinction between them, but rather a constantly oscillating  ambivalence along the border/line &ndash; as in French and Italian, each of which  languages possesses a single word for both functions: respectively <em>h&ocirc;te</em> and <em>ospite</em>. </p>
            <p>Translation  is a treasuring and guardianship of border/lines: a guardianship, in drawing  and redrawing our attention to what is on either side of the border, and a  treasuring, in ensuring that the lines stay open, permeable, porous. In  translation,<em> ownness</em> and <em>elseness</em> interplay (see note 8). </p>
            <p>The  border/line, then, is indeed itself nothing other than the <em>tension</em> between two language-zones, and consists of all their touching points,  including their fuzzy edges, overlaps, porosities and permeabilities, their  curves and irregularities, and their convex promontories that turn into concave  bays and vice versa.</p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">19.</strong></p>
            <p>From  the above discussions, it is also evident that in the act and process of poetic  translation, a measure of bending and extension (stretching) of both linguistic  and characterological (&lsquo;personal&rsquo;) identity occurs. This bending and stretching  may also be configured as a letting loose of at least some of the limiting and  constricting bonds of &lsquo;home&rsquo; identity, while never being entirely &lsquo;out&rsquo; either  of their control or of one&rsquo;s own control over them. </p>
            <p>It  might also be said that, being performed in the body of language, not only does  translation ease stiffness and rigidity but that by opening possibilities for  movement, it fends off the linguistic equivalents of rheumatism and arthritis.  Could it be that languages that emit and admit translation are more energetic,  pliant and flexible than those that do not? Periods when vigorous and beautiful  writing is produced in a language may indeed coincide with those when a great  deal of translation is coming into it, as for example in Elizabethan and  Jacobean England. Consider the most obvious example of all: the King James  Authorised Version of <em>The Bible</em>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore,  translation counters prejudices, whether merely parochial ones or those  magnified and consolidated by hegemonic languages. A  well-informed, carefully sharpened wariness of hegemonic languages is obviously  needed by those of us whose own language communities are numerically small,  fragile, and easily penetrated or brushed aside by bigger and more powerful  groups. On the other hand, an equally honed and subtle wariness is needed among  those of us whose first language is successful, confident, expansive, dominant,  etc. &ndash; especially if this hegemony extends to the point at which &lsquo;our&rsquo; language  is accepted by speakers of &lsquo;second&rsquo; or &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; languages as a <em>lingua  franca</em>, even to the extent of global colonisation. This double need for  wariness is ever-present above all because a hegemonic language constantly  tends to fill, occupy and turn the heads of its speakers with inflated  assumptions of their (or rather, our) own importance. Clearly, any such  assumptions need balancing and rebalancing by constant checking, querying,  criticism and challenge.</p>
            <p>The  art and practice of translation, through its pivotal and recursive  self-turnings, fosters precisely this salient, relevant and desirable  self-wariness and this balanced, apparently effortless, yet painstakingly  achieved self-awareness. In its zigzaggings and criss-crossings, its windings  and meanderings, its threadings, twinings and plaitings, its doubly and triply  helical curvings, its overlappings and loopings, its knottings and unknottings,  its passages through fuzzinesses and ambiguities, and its theoretically  infinite fractal complexities &ndash; translation moves into and out of no-man&rsquo;s  lands to explore language X. And in doing this, on and across border/lines,  translation establishes common humanity: that is to say, it invokes and posits  a human communality beyond the self-limiting definitions and ideologies of such  limiting ideologies as tribalism, racialism and nationalism. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">20.</strong></p>
            <p>Along  all linguistic border/lines, the practice of literary translation echoes John  Donne&rsquo;s tremendous, universal call:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>No  man is an <em>Iland</em>, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the <em>Continent</em>,  a part of the <em>maine</em>; if a Clod bee washed away by the <em>Sea</em>, <em>Europe</em> is the lesse, as well as if a <em>Promontorie</em> were, as well as if a <em>Mannor</em> of thy <em>friends</em> or of <em>thine own</em> were; any mans <em>death</em> diminishes <em>me</em>, because I am involved in <em>Mankinde</em>; And therefore  never send to know for whom the <em>bell</em> tolls; It tolls for <em>thee</em>.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><sup>22</sup></a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Similarly,  every modern literary translation reiterates Octavio Paz&rsquo;s transferral of  Donne&rsquo;s claim into relative space-time: &ldquo;For the first time in our history, we  are contemporaries of all humanity.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><sup>23</sup></a> The phrase &ldquo;all humanity&rdquo; implies all the dead, all the living and all the  unborn, in all places and at all times. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">21.</strong></p>
            <p>The  question of the relatedness of contemporary languages to geographical  movements, broached in the first section of this introduction, is worth  exploring in more detail in the particular context of this anthology, since the  places of residence of the author-translators in the &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;  project and the mobility of their languages suggest fascinating patterns in  themselves.</p>
            <p>The  contributors include many practising poets, novelists, critics and scholars who  move apparently effortlessly between different languages and cultures. They do  so in comparable but subtly different ways. Some write in languages that  traverse political boundaries. Some, who have always lived in the countries of  their birth, are bilingual, trilingual or quadrilingual, simply because  multilingualism is their social norm and required for their daily existence.  Some of the writers combine work as professional literary translators with  academic teaching posts, whether in the country of their first language or not.  Several authors write in languages that have been peripheralised and pushed  into corners by the encroachment of numerically bigger and more powerful  languages. Others live in necessary exile because their languages or their  political views, or both, are at odds with the views of the powers-that-be in  the countries of their birth. Some write in languages that have no country at  all. (For a fuller exploration of patterns of location and mobility, both  linguistic and geographical, among contributors to this anthology, see <strong>Notes [1] </strong>in the <strong>Afterwords</strong>.)&nbsp; <strong> </strong></p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">22. </strong></p>
            <p>The  picture that builds up from this kind of evidence is only partly that of the  traditional and possibly expected model of territorially based languages. To make  this point is of course not to challenge the vital if obvious truth that  languages belong to communities and that communities inhabit particular areas  and regions. Most if not all languages are indisputably territorial and their  distribution follows ecological principles of competition, colonisation,  struggle for survival space, and interdependence in any given habitat. Faroese,  Maltese and Shetlandic, for example, belong and adhere to their islands as  marks of irreducible and proud identity, just as Ebira, Hausa, Ibibio, Igbo,  Lumasaba, Nigerian Pidgin English, North Eastern English (&lsquo;Pitmatic&rsquo;), Nupe,  Runyankole, Sepedi, South Alemmanic (Dornbirnerisch), Triestino and Yoruba do  in their own regions.&nbsp; All these languages  are represented in this anthology. </p>
            <p>However,  none of these languages excludes the presence of other co-existing languages.  And as the outline of contributors&rsquo; physical movements and linguistic mobility  clarifies (see <strong>Notes [1]</strong>), with so many  people travelling, moving around and resettling, languages stretch, sidle,  squeeze, spin and slice through territoriality and nationality, almost as if  these social concepts and constructs no longer represented the apparently solid  realities they might have seemed to embody fifty, or even twenty years ago. </p>
            <p>What  emerges, then, is a far more complex and varied picture of contemporary  interrelationships between languages: that is, of an intricate pattern of  randomly and ubiquitously interlinked, interpenetrating and intermingled  language communities, whose border/lines are at once everywhere and nowhere. </p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">23</strong>.</p>
            <p>A  thousand languages can inhabit a single city street or block. &ldquo;New York  is virtually a city without a language,&rdquo; write Deleuze and Guattari.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><sup>24</sup></a> Many primary schools in the inner city of London  show a similar tendency, towards having no single majority language among their  pupil populations. It is estimated that by 2011 &ldquo;around 6 million people  resident in the UK  [&hellip;] were not born in the UK.  This equates to approximately one in ten people.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a></p>
            <p>Furthermore, languages that coexist in a  shared communal space, as it were rubbing shoulders with one another as  neighbours, inevitably influence each other, even when they are not  historically part of the same language family. Such influences may happen quite  gradually and surreptitiously. The flitting of so-called loan-words from one  adjacent language to another is only a small part of this process. </p>
            <p>To  many people, especially city-dwellers, linguistic diversity is a present fact  of life. To me, personally, it is one to be enjoyed.</p>
            <p><strong class="burnsred">24.</strong></p>
            <p>Even  if this is not everybody&rsquo;s experience, every language is potentially and  virtually a world language and, in that sense, every language is both  extraterritorial and universal.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a></p>
            <p>This anthology,  including the biographies of its author-translators and this introduction,  shows clearly that in our contemporary world, territories, countries and  professions no longer serve as containers or niches for speakers of any one  single hegemonic language, but rather for richly variegated and saturated  solutions of many languages. Out of each and all of these languages, poems  crystallise. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              The  &lsquo;Volta&rsquo;  project, then, is not merely an affirmation of multilingualism. It issues an  implicit claim, made gradually more explicit here, that multilingualism and  diversity constitute our defining contemporary linguistic, cultural, literary  and poetic reality. In attempting at least a preliminary outline of some  guiding principles for a viable future poetics, this anthology, including this  essay, may form part of a larger communal project. </p>
            <p>Such  a poetics might be called universalist. It could also be called the poetics of  the border/line.</p>

            <p>As the times of  writing this (October 28, 2009, February 23, 2010, and July 15, 2010), I intend to go  on gathering translations of&nbsp; &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; into more  languages. I hope that a future expanded version of this anthology will be  published at a later date, possibly as a book. I would especially like to  include more translations from African languages, Asian languages including the  Indian subcontinent, languages indigenous to Australasia and North and South America, languages of  transhumant and nomadic cultures, languages of small pockets, valleys and  islands of speakers, and, above all, languages that are threatened with  extinction. </p>

            <p>Here  are some examples of the immensely varied patterns of location and movement,  both linguistic and geographical, among the author-translators whose work  appears in this anthology. </p>
            <p>Parvin  Loloi, the Persian scholar and translator, lives in Wales.  The poet and scholar Bashabi Fraser, translator from Bengali, lives in Scotland  and describes herself as a &ldquo;transnational writer&rdquo;. The Chinese poet and scholar  Chee-Lay Tan and the Malay poet and scholar Razif Bahari were both born in Singapore,  where they continue to live, write and teach. The former has studied in England  and the latter in Australia.  Similarly, the Hausa translator and poet Ismail Bala lives in Nigeria  and has studied in England;  and the Maltese poet, translator and critic, Maria Grech Ganado lives in Malta,  writes in both Maltese and English, and has studied in England.  The Kyrgyz poet Soltobay Zaripbekov has  studied and worked in Turkey and has recently returned to Kyrgyzstan. Tumusiime  Kabwende Deo is a bilingual  speaker of Runyankole and English, who lives in Uganda and works as a human rights activist for  Africa-wide networks. The Lumasaba translator  Bob Natifu is a journalist and project manager, also from Uganda, who is now  working with VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) in the southern Punjab, Pakistan;  while the Punjabi translator, Toheed Ahmed, together  with his wife, Nausheen Ahmed, the Urdu translator, has returned to live in his  own country after serving thirty-six years in the Pakistani Foreign  Service, in Paris, Tunis, Hanoi, Brussels, Singapore, San Francisco and Dublin. The Irish Gaelic translator, Gabriel Rosenstock, is a  poet who writes in Gaelic and English and also translates poets from Pakistan. The Sepedi translator and professor  Mawatle Jeremiah (Jerry) Mojalefa lives in South Africa,  where he was born, and has taught in Germany.  Miroslav Jindra, who has recently been awarded the annual Czech State Prize for  literary translation, lives in Prague  and has taught in Canada.  The Yoruba poet Kol&aacute; Tubosun was born in Nigeria,  has studied in Nigeria  and Kenya,  speaks five languages, and is now teaching in the USA.  The American critic and translator Paul Scott Derrick lives in Spain,  where he teaches American literature. The poet Jan Lauwereyns,  born in Belgium, who has translated &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; into Dutch, works as a scientist in  New Zealand. He and I met in Japan. The Nigerian Pidgin English poet, Wilson  Orhiunu, practises medicine in England.  The linguist and scholar Olga Markelova, who has made both the Russian and  Icelandic versions, lives in Russia and often works in Iceland; while the multilingual writer and translator from Danish and  Faroese, Agnar Artuvertin, was born in the Faroe Islands and lives in Denmark &ndash;  where the Polish translator El&#380;bieta  W&oacute;jcik-Leese also lives. The Hungarian poet and translator George (Gy&ouml;rgy) G&ouml;m&ouml;ri, lives in England, where he used to teach Polish. The Breton scholar,  Rhysiart Hincks, was born in England  and teaches in Wales.  Similarly, the Ukrainian  poet Vasyl Makhno lives in New York.

            <p>A  project such as this is a communal one and necessarily involves a great deal of  work from many people, although of course responsibility for this introduction,  including all its shortcomings, is nobody else&rsquo;s but mine. </p>
            <p>I  should first of all like to thank all the contributors for the generous gifts  of their enthusiasm, dedication and time. Many of them put me in touch with  translators from languages other than their own. Special thanks are due to the  editor of the <em>International Literary Quarterly</em>, Peter Robertson, for his  hospitality to the original idea, his patient support and continuous  encouragement as it grew, or rather, mushroomed, and his attentiveness to  detail as assumed its current dimensions, which have turned out to be far  larger than either of us had anticipated. Particular thanks too, to Paul Scott  Derrick, Maria Filippakopoulou, Dylan Harris, John Matthias, Melanie Rein and  Anthony Rudolf, who kindly read drafts of this introduction and made immensely  valuable comments and suggestions. </p>

                <div id="edn1">
                <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">1.</a> The source poem  belongs to the sequence <em>Black Light: poems in memory of George Seferis</em> (Burns 1983; reprinted in Berengarten 2008a, pp. 147-176). </p>
                <p><em>Black Light</em> has been  translated into four languages other than English: Serbo-Croat (Burns 1986, tr.  Bogdana G. Bobi&#263;); German (Burns 1996,&nbsp;  tr. Theo Breuer); Slovenian (Burns 2000, tr. Ana Jelnikar); and Greek  (Burns 2004, tr. Nasos Vayenas and Ilias Layios). &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; had also been  translated into Italian (Burns 2007, tr. Paola Musa); and into Spanish (Burns  2007: 4-5, tr. Miguel Teruel and Paul S. Derrick). Together with the essay by  Maria Filippakopoulou  referred to in note 2 below, the existence of these  translations first gave me the idea for the present anthology. The translations  of &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; by Theo Breuer, Ana Jelnikar, Ilias Layios, Paola  Musa, Miguel Teruel and Paul S. Derrick all appear here. </p>
                <p>The title <em>Black  Light</em> derives from a line in &lsquo;Thrush&rsquo;, a poem by Seferis (Seferis 1969:  330-331). The ideas in Seferis&rsquo;s mind that underlie this phrase are explored  further in an entry in his journal (see Seferis 1991: 31). &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; contains a  further reference to Seferis in its epigraph (Seferis 1969: 110-111), as well  as the Greek word <em>Eleftheria</em> (<em>&#904;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&theta;&epsilon;&rho;&#943;&alpha;</em>), meaning &lsquo;Freedom&rsquo;, and  a girl&rsquo;s name.</p>

                <p><a href="#_ednref9" name="_edn9" title="">9.</a> The coinage <em>elseness</em> here is intended as rather more than an alternative to the words <em>otherness</em> and <em>alterit</em>y,both of which are familiar in philosophical and  sociological writing, for example in English translations of the works of  Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel L&eacute;vinas, and in the books of Zygmunt Bauman. </p>
                <p>First, in deploying the word <em>elseness</em> as an antonym for <em>ownness</em>, I mean to imply that the former indicates the idea of &lsquo;being another&rsquo;, or  &lsquo;belonging or appertaining to another&rsquo;. </p>
                <p>Secondly, and perhaps more interestingly, by <em>elseness</em> I also  intend a precise antonym for the word <em>thisness</em>, with specific reference  to the development by Gerard Manley Hopkins of his concepts <em>inscape</em> and <em>instress</em>, out of Duns Scotus&rsquo;s Latin word <em>haecceitas</em>. The difference between <em>thisness</em> and <em>elseness</em> might also be clarified in the following correlation: that  if both words were to adhere to or imply the presence (or experience) of  glory, then the former would indicate <em>immanent</em> and the latter <em>transcendent</em> glory. </p>

                <p><a href="#_ednref12" name="_edn12" title="">12.</a> In connection  with the discussion in this section, See Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s classic essay, &lsquo;The  Task of the Translator&rsquo;, some of whose arguments differ considerably in  emphasis from those in this piece:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&nbsp;[I]t is not the highest praise of a  translation, particularly in the age of its origin, to say that it reads as if  it had originally been written in that language. Rather, the significance of  fidelity as ensured by literalness is that the work reflects the great longing  for linguistic complementation. A real translation is transparent; it does not  cover the original, does not block its light, but shows the pure language, as  though reinforced by its own medium, to shine upon the original all the more  fully. (Benjamin: 79).&nbsp; </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As  indicated in his phrases &ldquo;great longing&rdquo; and &ldquo;pure language&rdquo; here, as well as  in the quasi-mystical suggestion latent in the presence of &ldquo;light&rdquo; in  association with the idea of the &ldquo;original&rdquo;, I believe the main tendency in  Benjamin&rsquo;s essay &ndash; whether he would have admitted it or not &ndash; is in the  direction of a transcendental <em>Tikkun</em>. This is a Hebrew word close in  meaning to &lsquo;mending&rsquo;, &lsquo;repairing&rsquo;, &lsquo;restitution&rsquo; and hence to &lsquo;desire for  original purity, cleanness, wholeness, etc.&rsquo; &ndash; as explored throughout the  writings of Benjamin&rsquo;s friend, Gershom Scholem, on the Kabbalah (see especially  Scholem 1991). By contrast, in focusing on translation as border/line, and on  &lsquo;language x&rsquo; as a concomitant tension between language A and B and an epiphany  arising from their conjunction, my concerns in this essay are more to do with  immanence and residue.</p>

                <p><a href="#_ednref14" name="_edn14" title="">14.</a> The words <em>verse</em> and <em>version</em> both derive from the Latin word meaning &lsquo;turn&rsquo; &ndash; the former  from Latin <em>versus</em>, &ldquo;a line or row, spec. a line of writing (so named  from turning to begin another line)&rdquo; (<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> online). This etymology  further re-emphasises the idea explored in Section 5:  that in the making of a translation, the turning that is involved in writing  verse itself undergoes a &lsquo;re-turning&rsquo;. </p>

The  difficulty, however, with this word is that it embeds a tautology, for the  condition of extra-territoriality necessarily implies expansion or movement to  a new, wider area of territoriality, whether by for example, migrancy, exile or  colonialism. As already suggested, it is hard if not impossible to avoid  spatial metaphors in this kind of discussion. </p>

                <p>This sentence of  Paz is one of the foundations of my poetics, which I have been glad to iterate  as a recurrent motif: for example, in Burns 1972, reprinted in Berengarten 2008a:  23; in the postscript to <em>The Manager</em>, Salt Publishing, Cambridge, Berengarten  2008b: 161; and in Berengarten 2009: 151 &amp; 159-160. The last of these  references may serve as an additional guideline to the &lsquo;Volta&rsquo; project:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>In  the wake of Paz, I have argued since 1971 that single monolithic &lsquo;centres&rsquo;,  especially national and nationalistic ones, are anathema, that difference is a  cause for happiness, multiplicity a cue for celebration, and pluralism a  prospect for hope. </p>

This multilingual anthology, conceived and born during this  particular revolution in global communications, involves both a focus on its  potential and a scrying of some of its implications for poetry and  poetics.&nbsp; </p>
