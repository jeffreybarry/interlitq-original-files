              And that endless rapping on the street door; <br>
couldn't they install a bell, a buzzer, consider<br>
other residents? Why does nobody ever have a key?<br>
And why choose here for their halfway house <br>
              at the tail end of a mind-our-own-business cul-de-sac,<br>
              with the old folks' home across the way?</span></p>

              three trucks per call-out - for burnt toast, mostly;<br>
              or, more sadly, a discreet, late-night ambulance. <br>
              Now every day sees a troop of displaced kids<br>
              with backpacks, holdalls, sandwiches, a hair's breadth<br>
              of hesitation in their step. Clearly they're obeying<br>
              instructions: where to go, who to meet, what to do<br>
            if nobody's home. Won't be staying long, of course.</span></p>

              What really gets our goat is the likelihood that<br>
              whatever they're up to is probably perfectly legal.

            <p align="left"><span class="texto2">You&#8217;ve been through the routine often enough<br>
              the wait at the baggage carousel, mesmerised<br>
              by a trundle of boxes, cases, backpacks. <br>
              Seasoned, you go it alone, navigate a route<br>
              through a trauchle of nattering tour groups.<br>
              At <em>Passport Control</em> you&#8217;re a model of patience<br>
              while grim guards squint at your unlikely likeness.<br>
              Innocent but purposeful, you stroll <br>
              through the green door: <em>Nothing to Declare</em>. <br>
              Your days of being plucked out by <em>Customs</em><br>
              to bare your belongings are well-nigh over. <br>
              Past the barrier, you&#8217;re brisk in clocking the exit<br>
              to taxis, buses, trains. You have your map, <br>
              your guide book, a room reserved, your phrasebook<br>
              open at earmarked questions: How? Where? When?<br>
              and yet at <em>Information</em> what little you&#8217;ve learnt<br>
              of the language deserts you, swirls off in a floss <br>
              of gibberish. You understand next to nothing<br>
              of what the desk clerk says, don&#8217;t trust her smile,<br>
              fear that beneath her stay-pressed blouse<br>
              lies dragonhide and spite: she means to teach you<br>
              a lesson you won&#8217;t forget, for daring to visit<br>
              her country, her desk, insufficiently fluent:<br>
              with her marker pen she won&#8217;t grant safe passage<br>
              to that <em>quiet but well-situated guest house</em>;<br>
              her directions will dump you in some dodgy quarter<br>
              to be set upon by ruffians who&#8217;ll subject you<br>
              to some horrible ordeal. You&#8217;ve been through the routine<br>
              often enough. By now you should know the ropes. </span></p>

              their places<br>
