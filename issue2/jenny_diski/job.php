                daughter of a minor aristocrat in the 16th century. She spent 
                her days in her father's library of 200 hundred books and by the 
                time she was a young woman had taught herself Latin, by comparing 
                texts. She also came across the first two volumes of the essays 
                of Montaigne and was so excited by them that she had to be given 
                a soporific to calm her down. She determined to meet him, and 
                to become a professional writer. The novel, <strong>Apology For The Woman 
                Writing</strong>, traces Marie de Gournay's life from youth and the outrageous 
                ambition to be an independent woman writer, to the lived reality 
                of her daydreams.</em></span><br>

              For Marie, her father's library in Gournay was an escape from her 
              present and from her preordained future. She slipped through the 
              dark panelled door at every moment of the day and night, whenever 
              she could escape being tutored how to be someone's wife, some house's 
              keeper, some child's mother. Jeanne or one of the servants only 
              had to take their eyes off her for a second, and she was gone. And 
              strangely, although they called out her name in mounting aggravation, 
              and climbed the stairs breathing heavily in search of her, they 
              only ever opened the library door, called out her name once again, 
              paused for the briefest moment before crashing the door behind them, 
              and giving up the search. Marie was invariably there. She sat half-curled 
              or flat out on the floor behind the table with a book or manuscript 
              in front of her, unsighted from the door. They entered, called out 
              her name, and then left. And yet they surely knew she was there; 
              that the library was her home in the world, her particular place, 
              where she spent her free time. Certainly they knew: 'What is in 
              that roomful of words that you like so much?' her mother often demanded, 
              without waiting for her daughter to formulate an answer. It was 
              her mother's question, to which she required no answer, that first 
              made Marie wonder what actually it was that she liked so much. For 
              the first few years, she could barely read, but she manhandled the 
              volumes she could reach down to the floor and turned their pages, 
              heard the creak and crackle, smelt the papery, cottony smell, almost 
              like her newly laundered chemise but more acrid, and the warm, spiced 
              scent of leather, like a wild horse tamed. She ran her fingertips 
              over the calf bindings and the embossing, catching the ridges and 
              smoothness. Turned the pages, stiff woven paper heavy with inked 
              markings that gradually became separated and recognisable as words, 
              then sentences, until eventually the full existence and meaning 
              of a book came clear to her. So at first it wasn't a roomful of 
              words as her mother had delightfully suggested, it was a roomful 
              of objects that had no other place in the world. Two hundred, once 
              she could count that far. The bindings were pored over, the pictures 
              gazed at, the pages turned. First they were objects that gave pleasure 
              to her all her senses. Toys. And then more. Objects with a function. 
              A room full of words, a room full of sentences, a room full of meaning 
              if she could only interpret them. The library became the world she 
              chose to explore. Gradually, as she associated the books with more 
              than sensual pleasure. She pulled down books and when she found 
              one written in the French she had by now been taught, she began 
              to read them, at first in a scattered way as a bee dances over a 
              flowering bush, and then reading on in a single book, getting the 
              idea of each being a discrete entity devoted to an interest of its 
              own. And finally, coming to understand that behind each entity was 
              a mind. That a book was an object filled with the thinking of a 
              mind which belonged to a single person, alive or once alive. Thoughts 
              bound between leather and kept forever ready for another mind to 
              explore. Her thoughts came and passed and went she could never know 
              where. But a book held a person's thoughts so that someone else 
              could entertain them, borrow them, enjoy them and then come back 
              another day, month, year and consider them all over again. Books 
              were boxes of thoughts, held fast by writing, made by a new breed 
              of beings called writers. Eventually, the answer to her mother's 
              question was so detailed that it was impossible to articulate. Simplified, 
              she would have said: writing&#8230;no, writers was what she liked 
              so much about that room full of words. But by the time she got the 
              answer Marie also knew that her mother did not want to know it and 
              would have been profoundly unimpressed with the one her daughter 
              had devised.</p>
            <p> Many of the books were incomprehensible, even once she had learned 
              to read. Opening volume after volume, she found the letters danced 
              as meaninglessly as they had when she was an illiterate baby. Her 
              shock was physical, and her anger at discovering that there were 
              still secrets the library withheld from her was sharp. She did not 
              know Latin. No one thought it a necessary skill for a female child. 
              She spelled out a title: <em>Aeneid</em>. One day, on another shelf she discovered 
              a second copy  called <em>Aeniad</em> and wondered why there were two. 
              When she got it down, she saw that only the title was in Latin and 
              that the text was in French. She read it, and instead of leaving 
              it at that and allowing the Latin version to rest on its shelf, 
              she had another thought. Translation was a unknown idea to her, 
              but if it was possible to take a book and turn its words into another 
              language then each word must have its counterpart in that language, 
              in every language. She imagined Latin as a code, like the codes 
              she and her siblings sometimes devised for keeping things from the 
              adults. Latin was a secret writing to which she believed she may 
              have found the key. If the two books were the same, apart from their 
              language, then if she read them side by side, word by word, sentence 
              by sentence, she might learn Latin all by herself. She scoured the 
              shelves and discovered several books in both languages. The child 
              may not have had domestic skills or god-given good looks, but she 
              possessed tenacity, and a dogged desire to understand everything 
              that was written or printed between covers. She had no idea of the 
              difficulty of the solitary task she set herself so she simply got           on with it, and on and on until very slowly and after years of work 
              she was quite fluent in reading and even writing Latin. It was a 
              game, an assignment, a marvellous never-ending puzzle to be solved, 
              as producing succulent meals, intricate embroidery, and a perfectly 
              run household might be to another girl. Marie lived in her father's 
              library in every possible way. It was her breath, her heartbeat, 
              and, when she moved permanently to Gournay, it became her Paris, 
              with all its hopes and dreams.</p>
            <p><span class="titulo1">2</span><br>
              The stolen library hours of Marie's youth in Gournay were a preparation, 
              though it was fifteen years before she knew for what. Apart from 
              her bookish explorations in her father's study, nothing of any moment 
              had happened to her by the time she was eighteen. It looked very 
              much as though nothing was going to happen to her &#8211; so her 
              mother feared. Neither marriage nor piety appeared to hold any interest 
              for her and she remained practically useless at the only possibility 
              left for a useful life: to be domestically competent enough to take 
              over the household duties from Jeanne as she got older. So far as 
              Jeanne was concerned, at eighteen her eldest child might as well 
              still have been eleven for all the progress she had made toward 
              a functioning worldly existence. She had become a woman in the sense 
              that her body was ready for its duties: she bled regularly each 
              month and her awkward, angular childish limbs and torso had softened 
              and rounded somewhat. The narrow, pointed chin and fleshier cheeks 
              gave her a heart-shaped face which just avoided the sharpness of 
              her childhood severity, and looked in some lights if not pretty, 
              then striking at least. But her beady black eyes were too prominent, 
              her nose too emphatic and her mouth too small and tight for most 
              lights. She was far from beautiful, though her plainness was alleviated 
              by the momentary succulence of her perfect youth. She looked tense, 
              always. Even when she smiled there was a tightness around her eyes, 
              and an ambiguity in the curve of her lips that could easily be read 
              as anxiety. When she wasn't smiling, which was most often, her features 
              contracted into a clouded concern that hovered on the verge of crossness. 
              Jeanne had no illusions that Marie would find a husband without 
              an enormous and continuous effort at style and manners, or at least 
              a greatly improved interest in household matters, neither of which 
              seemed to be her daughter's inclination. Preparations were already 
              in hand for Madeleine's betrothal to the Lord of Bouvray, a more 
              than satisfactory alliance, though it was a test to find the dowry, 
              and Marthe, two years younger than Marie, but far more personable 
              and accomplished, would not be looking for a husband for long. So 
              for her oldest daughter, as for her youngest, L&eacute;onore, it 
              would have to be the convent. <br>
              <br>
              Few of her father's book were left unread now, not even those in 
              Latin. Marie's progress with Greek was slower (her Uncle Louis had 
              helped her understand the unfathomable characters), but there seemed 
              to be very little hurry. The more books she read and the more Latin 
              she learned, the more it seemed to Marie that a good life might 
              be spent in the company of books. Everything else would be an interruption 
              to her reading. To become a nun would be a continual interruption. 
              Nuns were, she knew, less free than children to secrete themselves 
              in a corner and read whatever took their fancy. Marriage would be 
              an interruption. What time did her mother have to read, even when 
              her father was alive, even if she had thought it a decent use of 
              time? Taking care of a household and children took up all the hours 
              in a day, and a living husband might interrupt a wife even more. 
              She resolved to be neither a nun or a wife. She could see nothing 
              wrong with just reading books. But could a grown woman, by definition 
              with no formal education, have a life that was devoted to reading? 
              That is, did such a life exist in the world to be lived? According 
              to her mother, even reading in one's spare moments was a waste, 
              and she had never heard of anyone who could live only by reading 
              books. If such a one existed &#8211; she could barely imagine it 
              &#8211; it was certain it would not be a woman. Yet, the more she 
              thought, the less reason there seemed to be why she shouldn't. Except 
              for the matter of money. Only a too limited income might prevent 
              such a life. Money was very short these days, with the preparations 
              for her sister's marriage and the dowry. Marthe would need one also. 
              Charles was already costing a good deal in his military career in 
              Italy, and Augustin was still a baby whose future would have to 
              be paid for. After upkeep for the chateau, there would be very little 
              left over from their dwindling resources to keep a single woman 
              in a life of reading. But what would she require? Food, clothes, 
              a roof over her head. She had no interest in elaborate garments 
              or fine food; she could forgo any unnecessary travel if she was 
              in the right place to start with. Why should she not live a frugal 
              life, reading books, translating them, thinking about them? Of course, 
              she was not, and if she remained in Gournay without marrying she 
              never would be, grand enough to have a salon of her own, nor even 
              to attend one like those in Paris she had heard tell of, where the 
              thinkers of the day came to discuss and share their thoughts. Uncle 
              Louis spoke to her about the learning of Catherine de' Medici and 
              Marguerite de Valois, and the salons they kept where everybody went. 
              Mary Stuart had composed a Latin prayer and recited it to the entire 
              court when she was just fourteen. Women could be learned and spend 
              time in their libraries. They were great queens and princesses, 
              of course, with retinues and vast wealth, but surely, if she determined 
              to want very little and was content to read and think, rather than 
              discuss ideas with the elite of Paris, there would be enough money 
              left over from her sisters' dowries and the cost of supporting her 
              brothers for her to lead a modest, quiet life, her only expenditure 
              books, in some small corner of Paris, uninterrupted by domestic 
              or religious duties. Why shouldn't she? Because it was just a dream 
              of a life. There was no precedent that she could think of in any 
              corner of the social world into which she had been born. She knew 
              not to mention the idea to her mother, who would have reiterated 
              &#8211; horrified &#8211; Marie's fears that such a life was not 
              available to be lived, and doubtless made immediate arrangements 
              with the local convent.</p>
            <p>There were few visitors to Gournay, but from time to time her uncle, 
              Louis le Jars, visited from Paris and brought with him the scent 
              of the sophisticated literary world Marie increasingly ached for. 
              He was a secretary at the court of Henri III, but also a playwright, 
              one of those, it gradually dawned on Marie, who was recognised and 
              even justified in the world for the words he put down on paper. 
              His plays were performed. People paid for tickets to watch them. 
              There were, she came to understand, people who not only lived a 
              life reading, but who also wrote what others read, for a living. 
              It dawned on her over time that some of the books she read were 
              written by actual, living, breathing persons, and that these persons 
              were what might be called writers, as other were called wives or 
              nuns, some of whom, she supposed, must be paid for their efforts. 
              Books cost money to buy &#8211; she knew that only too well &#8211; 
              so were those who wrote them in receipt of payment? Aristotle and 
              Ronsard, Plutarch and Erasmus wrote, were writers, just like Uncle 
              Louis. Writers by profession. They had spent, and did spend their 
              time poring over manuscripts and writing down their ideas. What 
              they wrote was published. People bought their books and discussed 
              what they read in them, waited even, from the living ones, for the 
              next volume to come out. Behind the words between the covers of 
              the books she read, people actually existed. And one of them, Christine 
              de Pisan, writing over a hundred years ago, was neither a man nor 
              a nun.<br>

              Louis liked his niece and her oddness. He always brought her a book 
              of poetry or the newest romance when he came to visit, to Jeanne's 
              disgust. 'A household manual would be more useful,' she would snap 
              at him. Uncle Louis took some pleasure in telling Marie stories 
              of his life in Paris; she responded to them with a rare excitement. 
              He was actually a friend of Ronsard and other members of the Pl&eacute;iade 
              and brought her the latest volumes of their poetry. And quietly, 
              when his sister-in-law wasn't nearby to scold them both, he would 
              tell her who was saying what, in which salons they were saying it, 
              and what they were wearing when they said it. Marie listened and 
              took in every nuance she could grasp, like a young animal learning 
              the scents on the air, but there was also an anguish in knowing 
              that she could not be there among them, in the streets and salons 
              of Paris, nodding to d'Aubign&eacute; and passing the visiting Giordano 
              Bruno on the street, attending Garnier's latest play, buying the 
              new collection of de Ba&iuml;f's verse. Aged eighteen, and as removed 
              from nodding, attending and buying as it was possible to be, she 
              hated Gournay, in spite of the life-enhancing library. It was her 
              prison, her tower, where no prince would ever come to her rescue. 
              Often at night she lay in bed and imagined returning to Paris with 
              Uncle Louis, but for all her uselessness at home, it was out of 
              the question that she would be allowed to leave, or that, in truth, 
              he would want to take responsibility for an unmarriageable niece 
              who was not even able to make his life more comfortable.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1584 Louis came to stay for a few weeks and brought 
              Marie two volumes of a work which he told her had been gathering 
              momentum among the most discerning sections of society for the past 
              two years. Louis explained that the books contained what were called 
              by their author 'essays': attempts, tryouts, testings &#8211; it 
              was hard to define this word in its new literary coining. The writings 
              that made up the two volumes were not poetry, not polemic nor rhetoric, 
              but whatever they might be, they were really remarkably interesting, 
              and not quite like anything else &#8211; not to say in parts, Louis 
              whispered with a collusive smile, quite unsuitable for the delicate 
              mind of a young unmarried girl. Marie thanked him with her awkward 
              smile which though genuine she knew failed to convey her pleasure 
              and gratitude. There seemed to be an unbridgeable gap between her 
              feelings and what her face managed to express. In the presence of 
              another human being, even Uncle Louis, her body tightened, her shoulders 
              rose and her eyes glared and slid away from contact even when she 
              meant them to express warmth. She could feel the inaccuracy of her 
              body as it took instruction from her intentions and then continued 
              on its own jerky, withdrawn way. Yet behind her clumsily polite 
              acceptance of the gift, the fact that Uncle Louis, the playwright 
              from Paris, the bosom companion of the great Ronsard, considered 
              her someone who would want to read what everyone with discernment 
              was reading made her heart thunder with pride. </p>
            <p>Marie rushed the two small volumes to the library to wait for her, 
              before her mother could take them and tell her that she might read 
              them when she had unpicked the mess of her last embroidery effort 
              and satisfactorily completed another attempt. She would save up 
              Uncle Louis's gift for when he had left and there were no more stories 
              of Parisian life to divert her. Who knew when he would come again 
              with more books and tales? Lately, Marie had begin to imagine, though 
              she tried not to, a moment arriving when all the books in her father's 
              library had been read, twice, three times. Could a time come when, 
              after who knows how many readings, the idea of beginning all over 
              again filled her with the same deadly tedium as the need to organise 
              the following evening's dinner? At present it seemed impossible 
              that she would ever have enough of her books, but it seemed a little 
              less impossible with every volume she finished and returned to the 
              shelf. A new book extended the possibility of her reading life so 
              that she could avoid the idea of using up her library. Of course, 
              new books could be ordered from Paris, but the cost was immense 
              and her mother would never permit it, though Marie would have been 
              happy to spend her wedding or convent dowry on books rather than 
              a husband or that other secure place in the world. She worked hard 
              at suppressing panicky thoughts about a time when she would no longer 
              want to re-read the books she had, and persuaded herself that she 
              could not help but be content so long as she had her place in the 
              library (she still curled up on the floor behind the table, for 
              all her eighteen years) and there were pages to turn. A new book was the greatest of treasures.<br>
              <br>
              In the world beyond Paris and the chateau in Gournay, the wars between 
              the believers in the old and new religions had reignited after a 
              lull. Towns were laid to siege, battles devastated the countryside, 
              impoverishing and killing citizens of both, but miraculously, at 
              least for now, Picardie was calm in the midst of the troubles. It 
              was unlikely to be immune, however, to a season of plague which 
              was beginning to sweep through Southern France and work its way 
              north. All the more reason for staying where one was, living inside 
              the protective, provincial walls of the chateau and keeping oneself 
              to oneself. Marie had started to make translations of Virgil. Jeanne, 
              harried and getting older, fretted about Madeleine's forthcoming 
              marriage arrangements, encouraged Marthe to refine her domestic 
              and social skills before her presentation in Paris once the danger 
              of plague had died away, and permitted L&eacute;onore to spend all 
              the time she wanted with the nuns of the local convent even if it 
              did mean a certain risk in breathing the air of the outside world. 
              There was little she could do about Marie except insist on her practising 
              household duties enough to prevent an actual deterioration in her 
              limited abilities. Louis returned to Paris, the court, the salons, 
              the theatres, the writers, rested but enthused to be back in the 
              real world in spite of its dangers. It was time for Marie to attend 
              to the books on the library table and find out what the discerning 
              Parisians were finding so interesting. It was time, also, to discover 
              what all the years of her reading and devotion to the library had 
              been preparing her for.<br>
              <br>
              The two small volumes waited for Marie on the library table, side 
              by side. Louis had had them nicely bound. Nothing elaborate, no 
              tooling, just plain tanned calfskin, quite smooth to the eye, soft 
              to the touch, though with a light stroke her fingertips could discern 
              the natural undulations of the leather. Marie picked up one of the 
              books and held it in her hand. It was thick and quite weighty, but 
              no more than the height and width of her prayer book and lay comfortably, 
              barely overlapping her palm. Closing her hand around the bulky volume, 
              solid in her grasp, she brought it up close to her face and with 
              both hands she opened it and snapped it closed several times, causing 
              puffs of air, as if from the life's breath inside the covers, to 
              blow coolly on to her skin. She opened it and lifted it to her nose 
              to inhale the smell of new leather and freshly produced rag. The 
              sharp scent of paper hit the back of her throat, then deepened and 
              darkened into the complex smell of treated hide, both animal and 
              chemical, and finally she caught the special high note of newness. 
              None of the books in the library smelled quite like this any more. 
              The perfume of a new book was like nothing else. After she had read 
              these volumes and they lived on the shelves beside or beneath the 
              other books, they would take on their smell. Old library. A much 
              more intricate scent than newness which included the indefinable 
              odour of having been read. These days, being herself an integral 
              part of the library, a hint of Marie mingled with leather and rag, 
              wood, dust and time. She hoped too that the aroma of books had merged 
              permanently with her own personal smell so that she carried it with 
              her everywhere. She never opened the windows of the library, fearing 
              that its perfume would escape, or that the scent of bright spring 
              or autumn, icy winter or torrid summer would enter and be incorporated, 
              detracting from the precious aroma of stale bookishness. The library 
              had become a living, developing entity to Marie. It had a creatureness 
              into which she hoped to become inextricably merged. It breathed 
              and brooded, waited, and once when she was younger, had expressed 
              itself to her directly. One stiflingly hot, dry day, as she crouched 
              on the floor behind the table leafing through a hefty book of maps, 
              there was a sudden commotion on the other side of the room that 
              made her jump up in fright. A snap like a whip being cracked and 
              then a loud slap of an object landing heavily. When she got the 
              courage to go across the room and investigate, she saw an octavo 
              edition of Plutarch's Lives in French lying open, face down on the 
              wooden floorboards, several feet away from where it had been shelved. 
              Unless there were ghostly others in the room (an idea she considered 
              and set aside to think about later), it had leapt out and away from 
              its place of its own accord. Made a bid for freedom. Had it wanted 
              to be read? A book that jumped from its shelf, a wilful book that 
              desired to make itself known to her. An army of ghostly others could 
              not have excited her imagination more. She let the ghosts out of 
              her mind to go their way, picked up the book, and acceding to its 
              wishes, took it back with her to her place on the floor behind the 
              table, marvelling at the life it contained, even before she discovered 
              the life of the words she read between the yellowish vellum binding.</p></td>
