So at the moment the whole text is lying on the cutting room floor - and these pieces are (in film terms) outtakes or (in musical terms) &eacute;tudes.

              <p align="left"><span class="texto2">We all live noisy lives. We choose to live noisy lives.  We choose to banish silence from modernity. We exile it to the desert where the  hermits went to seek it. We forget, we choose to forget, just how much silence  there is. It is everywhere, necessary, secret and very powerful.<br>
                  <br>
                We forget, we choose to forget, how many of the major  physical forces on which we depend are silent &ndash; gravity, electricity, light, tides,  the turning of the seasons of the years, the unseen and unheard spinning of the  whole cosmos.</span></p>
				<p align="left">The earth spins, it spins fast. It spins about its own axis at 465.11m per  second (at the Equator); it orbits the sun at 107,218 km per hour. And  the whole solar system spins through the spinning galaxy, at speeds we had  better not dare to think about. The earth&rsquo;s atmosphere spins with it, which is  why we do not feel it spinning. It is whizzing through space so fast that when  its outermost fringes collide with the dust that comets have shed in their  passing, it does so at such speed that the friction sets them on fire, and they  plunge into the atmosphere burning as they fall. We call them shooting stars.  The earth spins and we spin with it, we are earth, we are clay, and the  spinning shapes us, forms us &ndash; earthenware vessels on the potter&rsquo;s wheel of the  planet. It all happens silently<br>
                <br>
Growth is silent too. Cells divide, sap flows, bacteria multiply, energy runs  thrilling through the earth, but without murmur of sound. &ldquo;The force that  through the green fuse drives the flower&rdquo; is a silent force. There are layers  upon layers of this silence. Deep, deep underground the great sly tectonic  plates shift: they push up mountain ranges, empty oceans, divide continents. Slowly,  inexorably, they move, at about the speed that finger nails grow and as  silently.<br>
<br>
Miles above these dark shifting plates is soil. Soil, that very topmost skim  coating, is called earth and the planet itself is called earth. It is all alive  - pounding, heaving, thrusting. Microscopic fungi-spoors grow, lift pavements  and fell houses. We hear the crack of the pavements and the crash of the  buildings &ndash; such human artefacts are inevitably noisy, but the fungus itself  grows silently. Perhaps we are wise to be terrified of silence &ndash; it is the  terror that destroyeth in the noontime.<br>
<br>
The winters are long on the high northern moors where I live. The days are  short and the grass is grey-brown. It looks and feels dead. Each year I tell  myself that this time I will observe the spring. I will remark and record it &ndash;  the first pale green buttons that will be the hawthorn leaves; the first stiff  shoots that will be the daffodils; the day of the week when the old wood in the  valley looks green from above; the steady progress of aconite, snowdrop,  primrose, until one morning where just a moment ago, just last time I looked,  there was only leaf mulch and dead twigs, there is a haze of blue under the  trees, vibrating where the sun finds it and almost misty in the shade - bluebells.  And young beech leaves, pale gold-green and translucent with silent joy, from  nowhere, from dead twigs, like magic, but not magical, just ordinary. I never  do: the growth is always too subtle, too sudden and too silent. I am caught  unawares once again.<br>
<br>
In the summer though I do better. In the summer gardeners garden; we become  active partners in all that silent growth. I do not make it happen, but I share  in it happening. The earth works its way under my nails and into my  fingerprints. In one&rsquo;s own garden one must not be caught unawares &ndash; a single  sprout of couch grass can grow five miles of root in a year, while lurking  silently behind the delphiniums which are growing less extravagantly but just  as determinedly in the opposite direction &ndash; up, up, upwards, and creating a  magnificence of blue as though they were pulling the sky down to them. I have  to pay attention.<br>
<br>
Hermits garden. Improbably high in the Himalayas; in northern caves and on  rocky islands, in middle-eastern deserts, you can see them, digging,  scrabbling, weeding, watering, growing what they can &ndash; vegetables, a little  grain and even flowers, unexpected beauty in the harsh silence of their lives.  They are seeking silence as close to the earth, to the silent power of growth  as possible, becoming, as they would say, grounded. Traditional Christian  monastic life is built around two silent enclosures &ndash; the church and the  cloister, which is also a garden - the secret, enclosed space, the <em>hortus conclusus</em>. The word Paradise  comes from a Persian word for garden.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I think that all this rooting about in mud and mythology is both a  reversal of and rehearsal for the rich earthy silence of death. Whether or not  there will be a heaven and whether or not it will be silent we cannot know, but  we do know with absolute certainty, that, as dust or as ashes, we will rot down  into the earth and peonies will grow out of what were once our navels, and  roses out of our mouths and apple blossom out of our vaginas. </p>

                <span class="titulo1">Air</span></p>
              <p align="left">We dream of flying. We dream of angels and dragons and  butterflies &ndash; free and weightless, swimming in the invisible air.<br>
                  <br>
                We dream of wings. Yesterday afternoon I encountered my barn owl, if I can say  &ldquo;my&rdquo; of a barn owl who happens to live in a ruin I happen to own. She is not  mine any more than I am hers. Barn owls are pale, almost white sometimes; they  do not make the famous twit-twoo sound their tawny cousins make and they live  in the desolate high places. They are crepuscular as well as nocturnal. The  wind tends to drop at sundown and the colour fades out of the rough grass and  there is often a moment of almost perfect stillness. This is when I am most  likely to see her, other than ghostly in the car headlights on dark nights.  Yesterday, just then, I came round the corner of my house and there she was,  perched on the drystone dyke. We regarded each other for a long moment. She has  feathered legs, like snug plus fours; her heart-shaped face and wide black eyes  really do look wise. Then she took off, immensely strong and smooth, with her  deep owl wing beats and her ferocious talons hanging down beneath her;  powerful, silent, free, across the buff hillside; then she floated behind the  broken gable of the bier and was gone. I dream of flying like that<br>
  <br>
                Last summer the martens came back all the way from Africa to their old nests.  For generations they have nested in the broken roof and crooked walls. But,  while they were away last winter, I had restored the roof, straightened the  walls and destroyed their homes. All summer they came, swooping on the wind,  graceful, skillful, skimming up and under the wide soffit, one by one; they  each placed a tiny speck of mud onto the new wall, building a shelf for next  year&rsquo;s nests. Sometimes there were thirty of them busy at this work, and yet I  never saw them so much as graze wings with each other. I dream of flying like  that.<br>
  <br>
                In the Peruvian jungle I have seen butterflies in clouds by the river, dancing  like confetti in the hot still air. So many that their wings seemed to make a  tiny breeze; which itself tossed them in the air. So light I heard no wing  beat. Fragile, resilient, bejeweled, made somehow out of the air they dance on.  I dream of flying like that.<br>
  <br>
                In the sixth month, when the evenings are long and clear, the Angel Gabriel  came down from God to a city in Galilee named Nazareth. Was there a silent  flutter of pinions, a stirring in the grass as he furled those glorious wings  and settled on the ground? Or did he hover, his feet resting on the air itself,  as he spoke? There was a silence in that conception, a silence never heard  before, and the wings of the Holy Spirit overshadowed the young woman. No  grunting or panting, no sighs or sobs, no high exultant cry. Just air and  angels. I dream of flying like that.<br>
  <br>
                We dream of flying. We dreamed for centuries &ndash; of witches and demons and Icarus  falling. Then we achieved the dream and it is dust and ashes. Aeroplanes are  noisy, cramped, polluting &ndash; they scratch the surface of the blue ceiling and  break up the silence of the night. They are &ndash; rightly, necessarily, tragically  &ndash; unfree, hemmed in by noise and by noisy safety legislation &ndash; even hot air  balloons and gliders simply do not touch the dream &ndash; the silent, free,  powerful, soaring, flying dream.<br>
  <br>
                I am hunting freedom and silence, like my barn owl hunts bank voles. I gave up  on air. . it was just a dream.<br>
  <br>
                And then &ndash; last Christmas I went to Liverpool to my son&rsquo;s home. Boxing Day was  a raw cold day with a harsh wind blowing in from the Irish Sea. Nonetheless,  after the pleasurable excesses of the previous day, we both felt in need of some  air and exercise. Suddenly he announced that he knew where we were going and I  would like it. We drove north through the city and up the coast; there was very  little traffic. Eventually we turned off the main road towards the beach. We  had come to Crosby and &ldquo;Another Place.&rdquo; Here for nearly two miles of flat grey  beach Anthony Gormley&rsquo;s one hundred identical statues stand with their backs to the  shore, gazing out towards the horizon. As the tide rises and falls, they are  submerged to a greater or lesser extent. As the installation stretches over a  quarter of mile out to sea, the furthest away ones may show only the tops of  their heads, or they are drowned.<br>
  <br>
                The beach was nearly empty. A few other walkers in the distance looked like  extra statues. It was huge, monotone and silent. My son got out his kite. He  had flown a kite as a child and he had told me that he was flying one again but  I had not paid much attention. That day he was flying a small stunt kite. It  took to the air like a bird; it seemed as though he could make it do anything &ndash;  dance, soar, swoop, loop, hover. It was flight like the flying I have dreamed  for so long. The kite was under his control and entirely free; silent in the  bigger silence; like a bird but tamed to hand; graceful but leaning on the  wind. &ldquo;My life like a bird has escaped from the hand of the fowler.&rdquo; We flew  the kite for hours in that vast silent space, though our hands were numbed with  cold and the statues did not turn to watch us; they stood still, staring  silently out across the flat grey sea.</p>

                <span class="titulo1"> Water</span></p>
              <p align="left">When the cosmologists and physicists look for life on other  planets, they look first for water, or even for an atmosphere capable of  producing water. No water &ndash; no life. In the beginning, first of all, there is  water and silence; later there may be land and language. We are born in water;  it is birthplace of all life and the birthplace of each human being. We frolic  for nine month, in the silent, gravity-free pool of our mother&rsquo;s wombs and swim  ourselves towards dry air. They say it is neither silent nor dark in the womb,  but from this side of birth it is. <br>
                  <br>
                Jacques Cousteau, the French marine explorer, was the first person ever to use  an aqua-lung, and so the first breathing person ever to move freely in water.  He describes the ecstatic freedom of that first dive:<br>
  <br>
  <em>To halt and hang attached to nothing, no  lines or air-pipe to the surface, was a dream. I had often had visions of  flying. [But] since that first aqua-lung flight, I have never had another dream  of flying. . . Delivered from gravity and buoyancy, I flew around in space </em>(1)<em>. <br>
  </em><br>
                Water, like silence, is always seeking its own depths, labouring to sink down  to the lowest point and rest there. People talk about &ldquo;sinking&rdquo; into the  &ldquo;depths&rdquo; of silence. It is good metaphor. Silence absorbs me and the further in  I go the more its strong pressure shapes and overwhelms me. In silence, as in  deep waters, you are free from gravity. And, like deep water, you can drown in  silence. People do. It is perilous.<br>
  <br>
                I love to swim. I learned to swim so young that I have no memory of not being  able to swim; and I do not &ldquo;fear death by drowning&rdquo;. On any summer walk, if an  appropriate river, pool or loch presents itself, I am always happy to strip off  and plunge in. I prefer fresh water to salt water, and like running fresh water  best of all. Water supports my weight almost effortlessly, but it has its own  silent strength. I hate public swimming baths.<br>
  <br>
                Once, for a little while, I lived on an estuary, the kind with a good deal of  tide and a great expanse of reed beds, which change colour and texture through  the year and through the day, because when the tide is high the reeds are  standing in water, but when it is low they are standing in mud. This daily  silent rhythm of the tide affects everything, even the light itself, refracting  the water through the reeds or flattening the tones out when the tide is low.  Tides are as silent as the moon that causes them, and the sensations of that  ebb and flow of the oceans shaped the rhythm of my days. I tried hour by hour  to capture the silent moments of change. The tide table, the times and  movements of the water, is not synchronised with the movement of the sun or the  better-regulated rhythms of the twenty-four hour day. Tides are immensely  complicated &ndash; there is a high (or low) tide approximately every twelve and a  half clock-hours, although this varies considerably, and so does the height of  the tide &ndash; in the case of my estuary the tide rose at different times of the  year somewhere between 5.4m and 9.6m above its median. This means that high  tide each day was at a different time and to a different level than the day  before.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                I had the use of a little rowing boat there and paddled about in the reed beds  waiting for the kingfishers, the herons and the diverse ducks to appear or  disappear. (I also waited for the otters, which are definitely there, but I  waited in vain.) I watched for reflections too, both when the water was as  still and clear as a mirror, and when it ruffled and swayed in the wind. <br>
  <br>
                One night, when the tide was full, there was an evening so still that I could see  reflections of the stars. Reflection in water is a magical thing &ndash; and the  double meaning of the word doubles the magic; I reflect, silently, on the  silent reflection of the stars in the water, and, in the sunshine, on the  reflections of dragonflies coming up from the depths to meet the real  dragonflies as they skim down on to the surface, which is a skin between the  two worlds. I would stand on the little stone bridge for hours trying to learn  to see fish, which can look like the reflection of trees but are not.              </p>
              <p align="left">My friend Anne Wareham, whose garden, The Veddw in Monmouthshire, is one of my  favourite gardens in the whole country, has a reflecting pool so perfectly  placed that the whole garden is pulled into focus by looking down into the pool  of silence rather than out at the garden itself. She dyes the water black, to  steady and intensify the reflection.</p>
              <p align="left">This is art, but nature can do it too. In the high desolate places of South-West Scotland, where no one ever seems to go, between the Merrick range and the  Rhinns of Kells, are a series of lochs. It is a long walk; and one afternoon I  came down wearily to Loch Enoch, which has, unexpectedly, almost pointlessly,  white beaches, which frame the dark water. And there were the hills and the  whole sky, its blueness and its clouds, held in perfect silence in the depths  of the water.</p>
              <p align="left">Silent water.</p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                <span class="titulo1">Fire</span></p>
              <p align="left">I did not naturally think of &ldquo;fire&rdquo; as a silent power. I had  to work on this one.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                Then one winter evening I was alone in church and there was a power cut. I do  not know what had been happening, whether someone was ill or had just died or  the local football team was facing relegation, but the votive candle stand was  packed, alive with tiny flames. Fire in the silence and what would have been  the darkness if they had not made their soft light. There, there was fire and  silence and they spoke silently to each other. Each candle flame is a tiny  silent fire, and they belong with ritual and worship. At the Easter Vigil, most  ancient rite of Christians, a single candle flame is carried into the dark and  silent church to celebrate the resurrection. There is silence and dark, and  then there is light and music, and it is fire that mediates between the two.  Fire is sacred.</p>
              <p align="left">And now, more secular, there are silent fireworks. Although I fear they were  created to address <em>petit bourgeois</em> notions of good taste, there is a deep magic in silent fireworks. There is  still the dark and the excitement and the return to childhood; there is still  that peculiar sense of power and fear as you light the fuse; the tremulous  anticipation as you step back from the dangerous beauty. And then, not breaking  the silence of the night, there is golden rain and green fire and scarlet stars,  and the shape of the landscape caught in sulphur light, both clear and ghostly.  A brief silent glory, and then a long drift back into the dark. <br>
                <br>
                (To be honest, silent fireworks are not completely silent; they start with a  thump sound, and silent rockets go up with the usual powerful whoosh. But they  are strange and glorious.)<br>
                <br>
                Candles and fireworks are small fires but the stars, including our own sun, are  huge. They burn and burn at unimaginably high temperatures for unaccountably  long years. They blaze and blast and spark, and they do it all in silence. The  explosions of their births and deaths go unheard throughout the whole cosmos.  Sound waves are not like light waves or radio waves; sound waves are carried by  the tiny vibration of one molecule striking another and bouncing back. Where  there are no molecules there is no sound; sound cannot carry across a vacuum.  So space itself is silent. Out there, beyond the atmospheric blanket, is an  immeasurable, vast and everlasting silence, &ldquo;the vast vacuity&rdquo; through which  Milton&rsquo;s Satan fell. No wonder the devil loves noise.<br>
                . <br>
                The scale of it all is outrageous. There are about the same number of stars in  the Milky Way (our own galaxy, and there are, they tell me, at least one hundred and twenty five million  other galaxies) as there are cells in my body. Between each of them is an  enormous distance - our nearest star, <em>alpha proxima</em>, is about five light years  away from the sun. Between each star is silence. According to the <em>Yale Bright  Star Catalog</em>, there are 9,110 stars with a magnitude of 6.5 or brighter, that is  to say visible to the naked eye (assuming ideal conditions and good eye sight).  Because space stretches out in every direction, you will never be able to see  this many from any one point &ndash; only half of them could possibly be visible in  each of the hemispheres. Nor will you see that many at any one time because the  earth spins them into view throughout the night. Nonetheless, 4,500 possible  stars sounds generous enough. <br>
                <br>
                But wait. You only have to pick up a reasonably good pair of binoculars and you  multiply the number of cosmic bonfires by ten. So now, if you have a very clear  night and a high place to view from, you can see 45,000 stars.<br>
                <br>
                Get a telescope and. . . the present &ldquo;best estimate&rdquo; of observable stars using  available telescopes is seventy sextillion (seventy thousand million million million).  That is more than all the grains of sand on all the beaches and in all the  deserts on this planet, but it is not all the stars; it is only the number  within the range of our technology. And between them all, there is silence.<br>
                <br>
                Well of course I got a telescope. It is a small one, but it is more than  enough. Sometimes I stand out there in the dark and my mind reels. There can be  something chilling and hideous in that enormous silence. There are so many  stars, and yet between each single one of them is those light years of silence.  Of nothing. The stars sing and dance utterly alone, unconnected by any music,  any gossip, any language. Sound cannot carry through space. It is all silence. <br>
                <br>
                Standing there in the cold night, I try not to think about anti-matter.  Scientists and mathematicians are currently saying there is not enough stuff,  enough material objects, molecules or atoms, out there, to make it all work.  There needs to be some dark material, invisible, immeasurable, but there. They  do not know what it is or how to find it. I am appalled by this knowledge; the  terror comes with the beauty and the joy. Perhaps anti-matter is all that  concentrated silence. Silence so dense and heavy that it takes on materiality,  and warps the silent travelling of the stars.</p>
              <p align="left">The expansive silence of space puts the tiny squeakings and pipings of our  planet, which seem too often both inordinate and fatuous, back into proportion.  Silence can look after itself. I don&rsquo;t have to take that much responsibility. I  just listen to the silence and rejoice.</p>
