              <p align="left">A day so grey. I did my laundry.<br>
                There was nowhere I wished to go.<br>
                Whatever pain I had left behind<br>
                <br>
                was better left. I switched on <br>
                all the lights in my room, all<br>
                the reading lamps and ceiling lights<br>
                <br>
                and still the day was grey.<br>
                I will place a bookmark in my book<br>
                and look at the walkway and the sea<br>
                <br>
                blueish-grey on the cover.<br>
                I will turn to the river and see<br>
                the same river I saw yesterday.<br>
                <br>
                There is no one I wish to talk to.<br>
                I will sit quietly in the bookshop<br>
                and hear what the poets say.</p>
              <p align="left">All the many trees of Iowa &#8211;<br>
                Norway Spruce and White Pine,<br>
                Cottonwood and Maple,</p>
              <p align="left">Linden, Ash, and Sycamore,<br>
                are as nothing to this tree of light<br>
                pointing across the river</p>
              <p align="left">and the sky leans down to say <br>
  &#8216;I am the tree their shadows create,<br>
                fallen, that you may see me,<br>

              <p align="left">Not the grass but the road, every road<br>
                is made for dapple. Shadow<br>
                can be as shadow was meant to be &#8211;<br>
                <br>
                grey and lovelier for being grey.<br>
                Red-brick paved, the precinct,<br>
                lined with bench and tree, is a flood<br>
                <br>
                of dapple, a dapple that lends itself <br>
                to smells &#8211; kerosene, coffee, street cuisine &#8211;<br>
                downtown in every city of the world.</p>
              <p align="left">The floor of the mind must look like this:<br>
                thoughts that have barely landed<br>
                lit with pockets of sunlight &#8211;</p>
              <p align="left">unthoughts, the workings of a mind<br>
                not ours, glimmering beyond us.<br>
                I watch people walking through the sieve</p>
              <p align="left">unaware how they are registered &#8211;<br>
                pigeons of shadow slanted on a shirt,<br>
                bars on a wall, stripes on a pelt.</p>
              <p align="left">We walk in the cast of mind that dapple <br>
                gives us. Nothing, not even the bright <br>
                acacia, the red and orange dahlias,</p>
              <p align="left">sparrows darting among the berries,<br>
                is lovelier than the ground itself.<br>
                And now that our lovemaking<br>
                <br>
                has accepted failure and limitation,<br>
                how gently we lie together, asking<br>
                for nothing, giving sleep permission.</p>
              <p align="left"><span class="titulo1">(iv) The Sculpture</span></p>
              <p align="left">Right from the beginning<br>
                there&#8217;s already a sense of memory,<br>
                the dominant suspending them<br>
                <br>
                above the home key, father and son <br>
                confined to their own stone square. <br>
                He&#8217;s squatting down to tie <br>
                <br>
                the little boy&#8217;s shoelace, ready<br>
                for the story to begin. His mouth<br>
                is open &#8211; &#8216;like this&#8217; he says.<br>
                <br>
                The right hand says the same thing<br>
                twice but the left hand is moving up,<br>
                creating forward motion.<br>
                <br>
                The boy peers down, riveted<br>
                on the knot; a change of key is created <br>
                by the smallest interval possible.<br>
                <br>
                We walk round them as round <br>
                the benches, bins, the fountain.<br>
                Attention turns to the bass.<br>
                <br>
                So many harmony turns<br>
                and a sudden darkening of the colour, <br>
                a middle voice like sobs, a very moving, <br>
                <br>
                plaintive voice, still in that <em>parlando</em> <br>
                we don&#8217;t expect to hear again.<br>
                Everything is being told.<br>
                <br>
                The little boy&#8217;s hands fan <br>
                like doves in silhouette,<br>
                both hands moving together.</p>

              <p align="left">The song must come from elsewhere.<br>
                I can only hear the vowels. Oh oh oh<br>
                the song sings. Then oh again<br>
                <br>
                like the sugar maple exuding small <br>
                gold gasps, then a kind of humming. <br>
                Me, the river sings, then ma, ah, ah, <br>
                <br>
                then some incomprehensible <br>
                play on y from Burma. &#8216;A hermit country&#8217;,<br>
                Mr Moe explained. Far off laughter.<br>
                <br>
                The song must come from elsewhere,<br>
                from some other organ. The word<br>
&#8216;organic&#8217; was first used by Aristotle<br>
                <br>
                to refer to parts of warships &#8211; parts <br>
                of a whole that made the whole thing work.<br>
                Suspended between the giant spokes<br>
                <br>
                of the wooden starboard paddlewheel<br>
                of the William M. Black (32 tons)<br>

                <br>
                Why am I awake? I have climbed<br>
                out of the pit of sleep, out of the river <br>
                itself. Foghorns call over Iowa.<br>

                of blue like a Fair Isle knit<br>
                but so finely done I knew<br>
                <br>
                I couldn&#8217;t afford it. Bizarrely,<br>
                the names of American&#8217;s ten <br>
                most dangerous men were woven in it,<br>
                <br>
                men who who had murdered<br>
                somebody close to me in my dream.<br>
                The Amish, like the Mennonites,<br>
                <br>
                are pacifists but, unlike them,<br>
                they practice shunning. We pass<br>
                the water tower, schoolhouse,<br>
                <br>
                the windmill and the cider press,<br>
                the birdhouse for purple martens;<br>
                the chicken house &#8211; caged layers<br>
                <br>
                for 8,500 hens &#8211; the clothing centre<br>
                that fixes buttons, zips, sends bales<br>
                to third world countries; outhouses,<br>
                <br>
                the Sunday School where services<br>

                islanded without our things.<br>
                <br>
                To say &#8216;island&#8217; as Milosz says <br>
                <em>is to be separated from the world<br>
                by a barrier difficult to penetrate</em><br>
                <br>
                <em>yet one that remains transparent, <br>
                a brilliant blue, and does not offer <br>
                a barrier to sight</em>. To say island<br>
                <br>
                is to reinvoke dressing gowns<br>
                and pyjamas flapping down corridors,<br>
                bells ringing, people missing,<br>
                <br>
                girl guide skills. Is to make<br>
                a saucer, a saucer of the sea.<br>
                Is to become a tea-leaf, a fortune<br>
                <br>
                in a cup, is to dig for termites<br>
                at the bottom of a tree. To say<br>
                island, island, is to name like Adam<br>
                <br>
                all your things: your <em>kotodama</em>,<br>
                your virtues and your sins. Is to make <br>
                loneliness disappear for good<br>
                <br>
                as naturally as youth does<br>
                for the island is ageless and time<br>
                is told, if told at all, only in beginnings:<br>
                <br>
                when the Seven Samurai are chosen,<br>
                the elected are trained, on the eve<br>

                Around her, a footworn path.<br>

                hiding a carved lily at the base<br>
                <br>
                of a tree stump monument<br>
                a midwife from Bohemia<br>

                <br>
                towers the Black Angel, who refuses <br>
                to look at the living, not unkindly, <br>
                but because she&#8217;s so intent. <br>
                <br>
                She could be learning the gavotte.<br>
                She could be learning grace.<br>
                Arms outstretched, inclining <br>
                <br>
                her head against one wing, <br>
                one knee bent, in the interval<br>
                between beats, about to take a step.<br>
                <br>
                In a golden bronze casting<br>
                blackened by oxidation and exposure,<br>
                her arms and feathers mottled green,<br>
                <br>
                thumbs and fingertips now broken,<br>
                she casts her kissing myths, murder myths,<br>

                (peace-stool) upon which<br>

                <br>
                much like the filigree of trees.<br>
                But the filigree is that of<br>
                letters, each perforated band<br>

                <br>
                if not to escape the cacophony,<br>
