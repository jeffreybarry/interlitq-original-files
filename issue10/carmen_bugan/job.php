            <p>The garden strewn with dry bean<br>
              Pods rattling on their stems<br>
              As we shook them out of sacks<br>
              Onto sheets spread on the grass.</p>
            <p>Holding thick oak sticks we sat<br>
              In a circle and beat the stalks:<br>
              Sending the freckled beans up<br>
              Free as heavy rain drops.</p>
            <p>Grandfather waited for the wind<br>
              With instruments for sifting:<br>
              A clean straw rug, a tub-sized<br>
              Wooden bowl and a tin bucket.</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s how he remained<br>
              Pictured in my child-mind:<br>
              A shadow in the summer breeze<br>
              Standing behind the orange sun,</p>
            <p>Hat pushed to his brow,<br>
              Hands lifting a bucket of beans,<br>
              Which sounded like a downpour<br>
              As they fell cleared of husks.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Preparing for birth</strong></p>
            <p>In a room with a wall of bright windows<br>
              seven women with bellies plump as November <br>
              pumpkins kneel facing the fruited trees.</p>
            <p>Morning sun comes to kiss now a throat,<br>
              now a cheek, a knee, or the space <br>
              between breasts moving with dreams.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll rehearse birthing sounds&rdquo;, says<br>
              the teacher, &ldquo;so bring your hands to the floor,<br>
              straighten your spine, breathe in, unfold your ribs.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>She walks among us, pauses to open her palms<br>
              on each bending back; we respond to her hands,<br>
              in-breath then towards ground exhaling &ldquo;aaaaaaaah&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>Turning inwards, an accordion forgetting language<br>
              and origins, I practice before the recital <br>
              as our harmony reaches towards the apples.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow we will be strangers again.<br>
              In the pain of birth, in the blood of life <br>
              each will be alone in crossing the miraculous.</p>

            <p>Here, half-gone autumn over treetops.<br>
              Up the mountain the snow has settled<br>
              already:&nbsp; a swan  beginning to nest.</p>
            <p>Today the seasons are mixed in my mind:<br>
              that afternoon when we planted flowers,<br>
              gathered forgotten, other years&rsquo; leaves </p>
            <p>then went to the village to be by ourselves.<br>
              How you come to me now like a pair of hands<br>
              rising from chest towards the lips, as if for prayers!</p>
            <p>Who can say what love is, where it comes from<br>
              or where it goes; maybe it was there<br>
              before we were born, waiting for our hands,</p>
            <p>in our hands it took flesh, with our fingers planted<br>
              peonies and gathered dead leaves left by those<br>
              from whom we bought this house, it sings in our children.</p>
            <p>The diamond ring arrived ten years later yesterday&mdash;<br>
              a messenger through time, like the light of a star <br>
              burning since long ago, reaching us here and now.</p>

<P><strong>After Twenty Years  :&nbsp; Reflections on Exile and Language</strong></p>
<p>On 29 October 2009  my family and I celebrated twenty years since we left Romania  under death threats if we dared to speak about what happened to us under the  Ceausescu regime.   On 17 November 1989 we were greeted at  the airport in Grand Rapids, Michigan,  by sponsoring members of a protestant church who braved the first snowstorm of  the year.  On 14 December 1989 the Revolution in Romania  began, ending just before Christmas with Ceausescu and his wife being summarily  shot against a wall.  We watched their  execution, agape, on a television given to us by our sponsors.  We spent the first few years learning English  and attending services in a school gymnasium away from our Orthodox roots. With  time, the Romanians from Grand Rapids  found us and we found a home among them, building together a little church of  our own.  My parents still live there but  my siblings and I have a more peripatetic existence so that now I am writing  this from the French-Swiss border, via England,  via Ireland.   My mother and father were political  dissidents in Romania.  They typed anticommunist propaganda at an  illegally-owned typewriter.  My father,  who had already been imprisoned for political activities during the 1960s  spending seven years in prison during that time, carried out a public protest  against the Ceausescu regime in the centre of Bucharest  on 10 March 1983. He was  tried behind closed doors and given a ten-year sentence for propaganda against  the socialist regime after which he was sent to Aiud, the harshest institution  dealing with political dissidents.  He  suffered unspeakable torture and periods of solitary confinement until the  general Amnesty of 1988 when he was released.   From 1983 until 1988 my mother, my sister, my brother and I lived under  daily surveillance from the Securitate (Ceausescu&rsquo;s secret police): we always  had to inform them if we were going any further than our hometown, they had  their own keys to our house, came and left as they pleased, day and night.  After my father returned, we lived under  house arrest for one year, after which were exiled, and given political asylum,  to the United States.</p>

<p>If I may be allowed a joke playing on an American clich&eacute;, I  can say that our exile to the States was like dying and going straight to  heaven.   This is not to reduce the  experience of our deracination or its significance but to signal that the definition  of exile has complicated with the post Cold-War mass migration.  What I mean to say is that I am not certain I  consider myself an &lsquo;exile&rsquo; in the traditional understanding of the term.  Not as far as my relationship with my native  tongue and not as far as my relationship with my native land go.  Now, twenty years on and nearly as much since  I wrote the poem &lsquo;In exile&rsquo; which reads &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve been searching for home/ ever  since the train whistled in the darkness&rsquo;(<em>Crossing  the Carpathians</em>) , a true exile is one who continues to speak his or her  mother tongue, who yearns for the native land and whose perspective in life (or  whose literary perspective if we were speaking about the writers)  is always informed by a deep need to return  to that native land.   The tradition is  very old.  We remember Dante&rsquo;s sadness at  ascending someone else&rsquo;s stairs, the way he defined the experience of exile as  loss.  In contemporary times we  understand exile through Milosz, who except his poem &lsquo;To Raja Rao&rsquo;, always  wrote in his native Polish and translated his work in English.   Nabokov, who wrote in English as well as in  his native Russian, spent most of his life translating his own work from one  language to another.   Yet, I chose to  write my poetry only in English, banishing forever the sound of Romanian from  my creative life.   I wonder if I ever  truly had a choice in the matter and I wonder if writing poetry in English  invests &lsquo;exile&rsquo; with another sense&mdash;complete abandonment of the past.  However, isn&rsquo;t the very meaning of &lsquo;exile&rsquo;  based on one&rsquo;s experiencing the new &lsquo;home&rsquo; through the yearning for the native  language and land?</p>

<p>I would like to explain myself and raise the question of the  importance of the notion of &lsquo;My faithful mother tongue&rsquo; (to think back to  Milosz&rsquo;s profound poem) to one&rsquo;s sense of freedom and therefore to complicating  one&rsquo;s identity as an exile.  What I am if  not an exile, seeing the traditional exilic circumstances of my physical,  spiritual and creative existence, I cannot tell.  Perhaps the definition of &lsquo;literary exile&rsquo;  must be stretched to include people like me who represent a particular  repercussion of politics between Eastern Europe and the  West, during the communist period.  Maybe  exile should be understood through the metaphor of adoption: we were &lsquo;adopted&rsquo;  and in turn we were quick to assimilate.   So, should I consider myself an adopted citizen?  One can say that adopted children, though  always given away by their genetic inheritance are encouraged to be more like  their adoptive family.  Generally they  embrace their new situation and identify mostly with the adoptive family.  With exiles, with refugees, that might have  been the thinking in America:  if refugees are placed inside American families (as we were placed inside a  church community) and if they are left to develop within the adoptive culture,  they will become more loyal to the local values, severing their ties with their  countries.  This in the context of the  Cold War means that the political refugees, like us, while benefitting from a  deeply humanitarian gesture, provided a voice against the home regimes, helping  indirectly the fight for western values.   Does it mean that I declare myself American, not Romanian, in my  writing?  No.  But it means that I cannot refer to myself as  a traditional exile.  I am  strictly-speaking an American citizen, I chose that.  Like most, I am a consequence of politics  much larger than myself, a politics between Eastern Europe and generally the  West, which is still very difficult to untangle and makes it nearly impossible  for individual people to place themselves in the world .  But because I am seen, correctly, as one of  those people without a home (a &lsquo;hearth&rsquo;) I feel that I must define myself as  something.  </p>
<p>Poetry arises from life. The aesthetic experience, however  imaginative and fictional, clings to the core of lived life.  My creative process is directly influenced by  my experience with my native language.    The effects of linguistic repression manifest themselves creatively:  I do not write in Romanian and I do not seek  the medium of translation for my work written in English for there is nothing I  want to say back to my language in my language.   I have suffered many interrogations as a child, interrogations which  denatured language with their brutality.   Everything we spoke in the house was recorded on tape by the Securitate  so faithfully that I (and we as a family) have created versions of ourselves  which simply did not want to offend the oppressors out of fear for our own  lives.  Not only that we did not speak  about missing my father and about the terrible things we were hearing and  seeing around us, or about the hundreds and hundreds of interrogations my  mother suffered, the fears that she might not be allowed to return home or that  the Securitate might harm or kill us.  We  became very silent all together, resuming our conversations to revolve around  the domestic tasks:  <em>Did you chop the wood?  Can you  bring some water?  Shall we air out the  rugs?</em>  We even tried to lie about the  time when we would wake up in the morning and take the bus so that we would not  give the guards outside the window the time to prepare to follow us.   This is not a language to grow up with.  A lot can be said about this, a linguistic  study of oppression needs to take place if one is to understand this  relationship of political oppression and the development of one&rsquo;s sense of  identity through self-narration.  Who was  I at 15, 16, 19 years old? Was I a silent girl, a lie of a person, a terrified  human being, a brilliant, surviving child?   Maybe my family&rsquo;s dossier from the Securitate, doctored as it might be,  might give a sense of just how much we were controlled.  Language is the product of culture, it  represents most intimately what people feel and how they live their lives, the  language of the oppressors and the language of the oppressed are products of  large-scale activities, not isolated incidents of abuse.   The Securitate developed a language  specialized to deal with the types of surveillance they carried out on people.  The number of people being followed and monitored and the number of people who  did the following and monitoring are so large, there is hardly any &lsquo;innocent&rsquo;  population left in the country. </p>
<p>For this reason, I have come to hate the language into which  I was born.  This is not a judgment, this  is an emotion which has lasted twenty-years; I am absolutely certain I am not  alone in this experience.  But this  phenomenon is also a very strong symbol of survival:  like water, if words are stopped at a dam,  they will go around and burst out in another place --in another language.  In English I was tongue-tied for sometime but  once I had learned the language I could speak honestly about what had happened  to us and to me.  Once this began to take  place I started to own myself, to have and to express my opinions, to write  poetry without fearing the consequences.   I became free and I declared my &lsquo;Salut au monde&rsquo; as intensely as Walt  Whitman declared in his poem that each of us is invincible, with his or her  rights upon this earth.  So I threw  myself into the English language and into life with fury: I danced on the  streets in the middle of the night not fearing the darkness, I taped my poems  to trees on the University campus in Ann Arbor when I was a student, I found my  father&rsquo;s files in the University library and I became proud that other people  knew my parents did not bow their heads, did not sell themselves to a  dictatorship and that we survived everything with our hearts and with our minds  intact.  Finally, it was I who banished  the Romanian language from my poetry.  It  had no place in this light, in truth-telling, in the huge effort to live as a  happy human being on the other side of the earth.  I never returned to Romania, except for  one-week visit in 1995 when I took leave of my grandmother who was dying of  cancer, because when my father put his life and our lives at risk in order to  bring down the Ceausescu regime, not one soul joined him.  People ran to see him, saw him and then hid,  terrified wherever they could.   </p>
<p>Writing in a non-native language has its own troubles.  For one thing, I speak about a life and about  experiences alien to the culture in which I write.  This, in the hands of someone who is a native  speaker can achieve a splendid, fascinating, <em>strange</em> effect, while in the hands of someone whose command of  English is imperfect can have a stilting effect if not crippling all  together.  But I have faith that I will  grow into the English language, even as it grows to assimilate the stories and  the language of displacement so commonplace now.  Writing in English is better than relying on  translation, for poetry in translation has its own category and there is a  completely different set of expectations associated with it.  There is also the question of reception of  the East European poetry in translation especially as it reflects the politics  of translation, which favors content over the achievement of poetic language,  leading ultimately to the marginalization of the poetry even as it is being  featured.  This paradoxical situation of  raising poets to the status of a heroes only to obscure their poetry may be  unintentional but it is a condition which puts poets such as Z. Herbert,  Akhmatova, Tsevetaeva, Mandelstam and Brodsky on the wrong pedestal despite  their lifetime efforts to write immortal poetry.</p>
<p>There are contradictions in what I am saying.  Recently I wrote my memoir from the period up  to emigration.  While I wrote this book, <em>Burying the Typewriter</em> , I felt the deep  call of my native earth and I felt the melancholy call of my murdered  youth.   I am a seed which sprouted from  that earth.  There are Romanian words  which I repeat in my English poems, there are songs and prayers which I sing  and recite to my son when he goes to sleep at night, and which open in me this  great chasm between who I think I have become and who I could have been had I  chosen to take my native language with me through the various countries I have  lived.  This is why I think the metaphor  of adoption works for my kind of exile.   Adopted children can grow as strongly and can have lives as enriching as  those of natural children.  My mother was  adopted.  She has created a rich life for  herself counting all her sorrows as blessings.    It is not bad to live on the side of forgetting.  But I want now to add: it is more complicated  than that.  Understanding one&rsquo;s condition  emerges from between these contradictions.   </p>
<p>As writers we must seek to understand our relationship to  our language and know why it is we treasure it, why it is we want to imagine a  better, a more peaceful world in it.    Those of us tossed up and down by the various tides of history have to  fight to find a place for ourselves in the world and in the languages of the  world, for this is our right.   That many  of us will reach old age and die without having a plot of land which we can  name &lsquo;home&rsquo; is true.  But I hope that all  of us will find the right language, in whatever language, to express truth and  beauty.  </p>
