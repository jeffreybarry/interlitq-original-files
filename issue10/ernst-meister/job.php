              <p>Ernst Meister,  according to poet and translator Michael Hamburger, wrote poetry that was  &ldquo;among the best German poetry&rdquo; written in the 20 years after the Second World War.  His was a poetry that, as he often said, arose out of nothing, the nothing that  exists between words, the space between a word and a concept, the silence where  language ceases to speak.</p>
             <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meister was born in 1911 in Haspe, near Hagen in Germany.  He studied theology, philosophy and German, and published his first volume of  poetry in 1932. During the war, he served in France  and Italy, returning to his studies and to work in the family factory when  it was over. He published no poems between 1932 and 1954, but, as he began to  publish again, he also began to win literary prizes. Besides being a poet, Meister  was also a painter whose work was shown in many exhibitions around this time.  He died in 1979.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His poetry is often regarded as  philosophical, and critics have sometimes said they could not understand it.  But it is not in fact difficult poetry or, if there is difficulty in it, it  lies in the fact that it demands a great deal of work on the part of the  reader. Full of religious imagery, his poetry plays with words and explores the  way ambiguities in language give rise to alternative trains of thought.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three translations here are from my 2003  book <em>Between Nothing and Nothing </em>(Arc  Publications), and I have chosen them because they illustrate the  characteristic challenges of translating Meister fairly well. The first is  typical of the succinct reflection on a natural phenomenon, which leads to a  comparison with his own state and is a poem in which, as in many of Meister&rsquo;s  poems, layout is crucial. The second poem contains the line from which the  title of the English collection is taken, and is, perhaps, an unusually  optimistic poem, but typical of the incantatory repetition Meister often  favoured. In the third poem a typical Meister word &ldquo;aufgehoben&rdquo; (which means  both &ldquo;undone, crossed-out&rdquo; and &ldquo;kept, preserved&rdquo;) has no equivalent in English,  and so in this version the line-layout is called into service in a way the poet  uses elsewhere to assist in creating the ambiguity: here it is the ambiguity between  &ldquo;is and is not&rdquo; and &ldquo;is and is not held&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meister&rsquo;s poetry is both serious and  playful. He deals with the big issues of life, love, and death, but he delights  in catching the reader out. A particular trick was to hide his name, in  anagrams, in his poems. His poetry is characterised, more than anything, by  compression: he is sparing with language, leaving the greatest possible space  for poetic effects on the mind of his reader.</p>
