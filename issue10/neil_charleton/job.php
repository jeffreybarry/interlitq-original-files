            <p>He studied the boy intently from across the street.&nbsp; He watched the familiar, angular body that  seemed never to rest and the long limbs that twitched and fluttered like a bird  in the throes of death. Against the coal blackness of his clothing and his hair  the other boys&rsquo; skin was chalk white. The three of them had just come out of  the shop, one of those open all hours&rsquo; places selling a bit of everything. One  of them, the smallest of the three, produced two bottles from his pockets. He  heard the chink of the glass as they made off running down the dim street,  whooping with excitement. Under the glare of the artificial light their shadows  made a grotesque puppet play on the pavement. </p>
<p>He followed them at a distance, a task made easier by their noise  levels. Attracting attention did not concern them. The park was a small affair  consisting of a circular path enclosing some ragged trees and a few benches  dedicated to long dead occupants who had, apparently, loved the view. Off to  the left there was a small children&rsquo;s play park looking like the remains of  some enormous, ancient creature now skeletal and dead in the half light.</p>
<p>Sudden doubt brought him to a  halt at the park&rsquo;s entrance, an urge to turn away, to simply go home and never  know. The struggle continued within him for a time, probably just a minute or  so but seeming longer.  In the distance  he could hear them, their voices loud and raucous and full of bravado. Stepping  through his fear he walked into the shadows. The three of them were sitting on  the ground, hidden in deep gloom beneath the trees. They remained oblivious to  him, oblivious to everything. Their concentration was focused on the moment, on  the now, on gratification. They took turns swigging from one of the bottles,  their elation rising and falling, illuminated by the pulse of cigarette glow. </p>
<p>He moved closer as the boy produced a plastic bag and the aerosol. A  sickness rose in his stomach, his skin moistened with dread. The boy discharged  the can into the bag and breathed deeply from it before passing it to the  others. Their conversation, if it could be called that, faltered as they  continued to take their turns.  The boy  refilled it several times before discarding the now empty can and the bag.  Carried by the light breeze the bag rolled  away into the darkness, a ghostly, silent tumbleweed. He looked around but the  space remained empty and indifferent, the suburban noise faint in the  distance.  They remained inert for a  time, stretched out on the ground. What was in their heads at this moment? He  was puzzled by that because he could never contemplate a moment without  thought, he could not recognise something mindless or the urge to obliterate  reality.  He could never understand but  he wanted to know.</p>
<p>Memory is an unreliable friend; on occasions arbitrary and selective, it  could protect or, sometimes, it could punish. He had some of those, memories  that still held the power of pain. Most people did he supposed but that didn&rsquo;t  send them to a grubby little park, to steal, to stick needles in their arms or  their head in a bag and anaesthetize their mind until their mind was gone. </p>
<p>The fact was that no one really knew. There had been the endless  procession of professionals, each armed with theories and therapies.  But only he lived with the guilt of failure,  the failure to stop the slide into this starless world. Nobody could help with  that; there was no absolution for that.   He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to blame the system despite all its faults.  The doctors, the social workers, the carers faced with a tide of misery to sort  out, with desperate people looking for a miracle that would never happen. No,  he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to condemn them. He had never been one to avoid  responsibility.</p>
<p>That had been his creed for all his life, responsibility for our own  choices, for our own mistakes. Belief in the hope that is tomorrow, a  survivalist&rsquo;s instinct to find another chance whatever may have happened. God  knows life had thrown him his fair share of strife but he had never crumbled,  never given into the urge to abdicate the living, breathing miracle that is  life itself.  But the invasion of such  subversion, such incomprehensible behaviour into his own life had all but defeated  him. </p>
<p>Back then his dream had not been extravagant, not unattainable. The  process had taken months with endless probing about his motives and an  encouragement towards self- analysis and honesty. Their question had been not  why do want to become a father but why do you want to adopt a child?  He had become angry at times, angry at their  apparent suspicion. It wasn&rsquo;t as if he had nothing to offer, nothing to  give?  No, he could offer a child  everything, or so he thought at the time.</p>
<p>His assumption had always been that in becoming a father he would  somehow translate his own experience into the creation of another life. How  na&iuml;ve it seemed to him now with the painful benefit of hindsight. If you knew  then what you know now would you still have done it, still have brought an  anonymous, alien being into your life? Stupid question he had always thought  but it haunted him nonetheless, the thought that his life could have been  different, that all of this could have been avoided by a simple no. But then  that is what life consists of, isn&rsquo;t it?   A series of events, many of which are outside our control, decisions  made in ignorance of consequences because those consequences are beyond our  ability to conceive them.</p>
<p>The boys had stirred and moved on further into the park, their noise  levels once more rising with excitement. He followed cautiously although they  clearly had a reckless disregard for their surroundings, immune to the  disapproval of the society around them. What would the boy do were he to  discover that he was being watched? Probably nothing he thought, after all he  had never admitted to anything even when caught red handed. A mouthful of abuse  and a violent outburst would be the likely result; something witnessed more  times than he could remember.</p>
<p>In the early days he had admired the boy&rsquo;s wildness, the audacious  behaviour in stark contrast to his own small town conventionality. He had often  smiled at the boy&rsquo;s antics, almost proud at times as he would recount tales to  friends and family about the escapades, the apparent disregard for his own safety.  Oh he was a boy he would say, just doing what boys do and one day would  surprise us all. He had held that belief for a long time; he had clung to it  like a lifebelt because he would not allow himself to believe anything else. He  should have seen it coming; he should have read the warning signs. But what  could he have done even if he had?  By  then there was no getting out of it, no walking away.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>A flare of light startled him. What were they doing? Moving closer he  could see a small blaze, one of the park benches appeared to be alight. The  boys were running round excitedly, the fire flaring as they squirted something  onto it. Lighter fluid most likely, it was easier to obtain.  In the scintillating light they looked like  primitives dancing around the god of fire, spinning and leaping as the fire  cracked and spat sending sparks into the ink black sky.  Their faces were thrown into contorted  expressions by the phosphorescence. The power of it kept him rooted to the spot  and he could only watch and wonder.   Despite himself he was captivated by this display of ecstasy, the boys&rsquo;  total abandonment stirring something in him, something basic and thoroughly  unpleasant.</p>
              <p>The sense of failure was overwhelming at times, the inability to make  happen what he had wanted to happen, the frustration of thinking it was turning  around only to see it all crumble again. How could the boy not want what he  wanted, why was he bent, apparently, on self-destruction?  Even his own motives were a mystery to him  now, the reasons why he kept turning up again and again, answering the phone at  all hours? Certainly it appeared to make no difference to the boy, whether he  was there or not. Others told him how important he was to the boy, that his  presence in the boy&rsquo;s life was vital. But what about his own life?  What about that he thought but never said.</p>
  <p>It would never be enough he had  decided a long time ago, whatever he did would probably never be enough, it  would not end until he was cold in the ground. What would the boy do then? In  his anger he had sometimes challenged the boy with that very question,  desperate to break through the shell of indifference. But he remained impotent,  alone with an acute awareness that everything else in his life was eclipsed,  that whatever he had achieved would always be overshadowed by this, this  castrated fatherhood. He felt used and useless.</p>
              <p>The tree above the fire had now caught bringing further screams of  delight from them as burning twigs and embers fell, swirling around in the  light breeze.  The energy fizzed and  crackled as small blazes erupted under the burning tree. In his pocket he felt  the solid bulk of the phone. He should make the call, he knew he should but  instead he stood there, feeling the faint warmth of the fire, his will even  now, driven by an absurd desire to protect the boy. It was a delusion of  course, but a powerful one.</p>
              <p>That had always been his downfall, the refusal to see, to actually see  the reality. Perhaps he had always been like that, had always only seen what he  wanted to see; believed what he wanted to believe. The truth that he had a  child such as this was something he had found almost impossible to acknowledge  and so he had entered a kind of denial. Certainly he had researched the  clinical psychology of it all trying to understand the issues as the  professionals would say. He had attended meetings, schools, education  authorities, child psychiatrists, the list was endless. Each time a faint hope  would emerge, a small glimmer of light at the end of his tunnel, but it would never  last for long. Within a few days, a few hours in some cases, the light would  vanish, the hope evaporate.  And so he  was ground down, worn thin until denial was the only way to hang onto whatever  was left of his own life. It didn&rsquo;t change anything of course but then he no  longer believed change was possible. </p>
              <p>Nature over nurture someone had told him once, it&rsquo;s in the genes and you  can&rsquo;t do anything about it.  But for  years he had hoped and worked and sacrificed never wanting to believe in never,  wanting to know what real fatherhood felt like, what pride in a child really  felt like, convincing himself that, in the end, the boy would come through,  would reflect something of himself. Wasn&rsquo;t that what parenthood was about,  sacrifice, love, support and then watch a young life flourish and grow into  something beautiful?  Apparently not, at  least not for him and not for the boy. The angry tears felt cool against his  hot cheeks. He tasted the saltiness in his mouth and wondered what he would do  with all that anger.</p>
              <p>The boys were dancing now with a kind of mad energy as they frantically  looked around for anything that might feed the fire, something to appease their  god, something to feed their obsession. It was almost hypnotic standing there  in the flickering shadows watching the fire consume everything; the beginning  and end, life and death.</p>
              <p>A noise made him turn around. A couple stood open mouthed at the park&rsquo;s  entrance, their faces written with fear and something like awe. He saw the man  frantically push the buttons on the phone, it&rsquo;s small screen glowing. He  watched as the man put it to his ear and tried to speak, pressing his free hand  against his other ear in an effort to hear. The woman said something, pulling  at the man&rsquo;s shirt as she spoke. He put his arm around her and turned away  guiding them urgently away from the park, away from the madness, back to the  safety of their world.</p>
  <p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be long now he  realised. The three of them remained unaware of their discovery. The boy was in  the play area frantically trying to rip the see-saw from its mounting. The  others ran to help, shouting and kicking and pulling at it. </p>
              <p>He backed away slowly, still watching them, unable to wrench his eyes  away. He stumbled, almost falling over the kerb and, in reaching out to steady  himself, managed to cut his hand on the stone. The pain seemed to wake him as  if from a dream and he knew he had to go. He didn&rsquo;t want to be found here.  Later, in the car, he switched his phone off and felt the relief. He drove home  in silence.</p>
          <p>The inevitable call came. Arson and criminal damage to add to the list.  It always impressed him how matter of fact the police were, as if there were  discussing what to have for dinner. The boy would be bailed for now and they  were looking for a man seen leaving the park, a man who must have witnessed the  incident. They would let him know they said.   He hung up and wondered what he was going to do with all this anger. It  would probably kill him in the end, probably.</p>             </td>
