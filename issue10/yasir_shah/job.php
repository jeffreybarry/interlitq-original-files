            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trolley of <em>hope</em> and biscuits. <em>Chai</em> and <em>wishes</em>. Cashew nuts and <em>maybes</em>. </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A trolley, that was presented to strangers her mother called guests, but  was now ready to be cleared off. Wiped squeaky clean by the dampness of a dirty  rag. The food &ndash; and the plates that contained it &ndash;to be pulled off, washed and  then placed back into cabinets where only the &ldquo;special-occasion&rdquo; china was  kept. China, so  exclusive, that on most days it only peeked from behind a glass cabinet and a gathered  coat of its own dust. Peeping patiently for evenings when it would be summoned  out, but only for those certain special guests. Neither for neighbors nor for  family. Not, even for friends. Especially not for her own friends or that  annoying woman who showed up unannounced to brag about her daughters and their  husbands. But, for those peculiar strangers who were politely referred to as  guests. How a stranger could possibly manage to fit into the dignified role of  a guest, she had no idea, nor did she question the logic. Probably because  these strangers brought with them&hellip; <em>hopeful</em> <em>wishes</em> that <em>maybe</em>&hellip;it would happen this time. They might be the ones... </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So they were presented fresh biscuits from the corner bakery, steaming  cups of <em>chai</em> and a perfect assortment  of nuts on a trolley so ornate and spotless it would reassuringly carry  ingredients of a prayed miracle.&nbsp; </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The guests were gone now. The <em>chai</em> had been enjoyed. The food, though not all devoured, was at least tasted. A few  crumbs of the biscuits sprinkled over painted daisies of the exclusive china;  like residue debris. The mixed assortment of nuts had even been poked at with  tacky nail polish throughout the evening. The cashew nuts seemed to have been a  definite hit with this family. Even pistachios were savored through lips that  matched the color of the tacky pink nails. But almonds remained untouched. <em>Maybe</em> they were truly tasteless, m<em>aybe</em> because they were stuck with brown  skin and had not the paleness of other nuts. </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She <em>hoped</em> she would never feel  like an almond again after tonight. </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Chai</em>, though also the color of  almond peels, was relished to its last sip. Saucers, boasting sticky brown  halos around circles where cups were glued to the tea&rsquo;s own sugariness.  Different shades of red blemishing the edge of each cup where lips had touched  slightly. Lips that blew away the scald before cautiously swallowing succinct  gulps, like scared first kisses in the back of a storage room. The lingering  sweetness of tanned sugar, at the bottom of these crimson-bordered cups. </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And then the cake. There was always a cake. It was essential. Almost  obligatory. For some reason or the other, her mother felt that the addition of  a frosted cake would prove to be an apt substitute for a love potion. However,  only a wedge was fractioned out, tasted and then put aside with a fork weighed  down with a large glob of baked cream. </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then they were gone. The strangers, the guests. All that remained were  the left-over biscuits, a few last drops of <em>chai</em>,  and an unequal assortment of nuts, along with <em>hope</em>, <em>wishes</em> and many  recurring <em>maybes</em>. She decided to  clear up at least the trolley and deal with the <em>hoping</em>, <em>wishing</em> and <em>maybe-ing</em> later. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Hello&hellip;who  this speaking?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;This  is Mrs. Syed, may I know whose calling?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh,  Salaam Mrs. Syed&hellip;it is Mrs. Ashraf speaking.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;How  you are doing?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Fine.  I am sorry I don&rsquo;t think I&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes,  yes. Bhabi Sughra &hellip; you know she close family friend yours.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh,  of course yes.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes,  she tell me about you and your daughter Bushra.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh,  yes sure.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;My  son Nido, he study MBA in </em><em>USA</em><em> college. Very smart boy!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Nido?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Nadeem&hellip;Nido  his nickname na.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh  how adorable!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;So  he in </em><em>USA</em><em> but my daughter Sadia and I were wonder if  we could come and meet you and Bushra sometime?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Why,  of course. It would be a pleasure to have you over. Which day would work out  better for you? Thursday?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No  Thursday not good. I go swimming you know, every Thursday. It is good for my  figure. I am not like old-fashioned women.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  wonderful! Very impressive!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Thank  you, thank you. Wednesday not good?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No,  why not. Wednesday is perfectly fine. Bushra usually has a study group at her  university that day, but I&rsquo;ll tell her to stay home specially.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ok  good! See you then at six in evening. Ok?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Ok,  bye!&rdquo; Click</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &hellip;Biscuits. Reminded her of childhood. And how guests, though still  strangers to her, never intimidated or questioned her beauty. A beauty she was  sure she possessed, but despised when strangers searched for it. Peering at her  flesh carefully and squeezing their eyes, as if it would suddenly appear out of  her face. Jump at them like a gilded shine which would dim her cocoa  complexion; magnified eyes hidden behind spectacles and a nose which was not  quite so elfin. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She was so sure she was beautiful as a child. No matter what she wore  and how she looked, the image she had, of herself, in an imagined mind, battled  with all the perceptions others had. She was not short, fat or dark. She was  beautiful. Like princesses with long blond tresses in Disney cartoons. She  believed she also wore long frilly dresses like pictures of fairies in pop-up  storybooks. And in her mind, she even walked, talked and felt like one. There  was also a prince for her. A prince who would surely be enchanted by her  beauty, someday. There would be no old woman staring at her and no photograph  of a nicknamed man for whom the search for the woman of his dreams was a choice  his mother was to make. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It was as simple as biscuits back then. As easy as a fairy-tale. And  when the guests would leave, she would stealthily creep into the same kitchen,  and eat the leftover cookies. Rounded baked rings sandwiching a layer of  vanilla that she pulled apart and licked at. Brown biscuits sprinkled with  sugar grains on top. And, oh those triangles of delight! She would devour them  all before her mother would walk in. She never ate the salted crackers though,  those tasteless biscuits. Who ate them anyway? Biscuits were supposed to be  sweet. Gooey with sandwiched layers of chocolate and vanilla. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And if guests were strangers, she did not have to meet them.</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But now she did. She was the reason strangers became respected guests  all of a sudden. She was the reason the trolley was so ornate, so spotless, and  full of lavish delicacies, as <em>hopes</em> of love potions. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She reminisced the days when the opposite sex meant obese boys in her  Geography class. Their elastic ties slanting to the right of shirts, their  tails dangling out of navy blue shorts. The only role their mothers played in  her life was when they came to pick them up from school, the playground or  birthday parties. Now these same boys did their Masters&rsquo; in business colleges  abroad and their mothers proudly nicknamed them Nido as they searched for beauty  in girls who were sinfully single. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reminiscing of those exact same childhood days, she took a bite of a  biscuit so sweet the pain pierced through her gums. It felt great! There were  no salty or tasteless crackers left. All that was left were powdered crumbs.  The strangers had finished them all. No, the guests had finished them all. They  seemed to like the salt as they boasted of taste.&nbsp; </p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sugared taste in her mouth, the  kind that pastries and Danishes invoked, she picked up the plate of biscuits;  the sweetened rectangles lying opposite the one lone salty cracker and began  placing them in their respective containers. She <em>hoped</em> they wouldn&rsquo;t have to be taken out for strangers and guests  anymore. She <em>hoped</em> that the strangers  who had just left would no longer be strangers&hellip;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Impossible  Ma. I told you I am not doing this anymore.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Bushra  are you mad? I stay up all night praying for a good proposal and you make it so  much more difficult for me!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ma,  you know what happened the last time and the time before that.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It  happens darling, maybe this family will like you. They sounded like a very nice  family. Very posh! She was even speaking in English!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Well  then just show them a picture of me like they show us a picture of their sons.  I am not doing the whole bringing-out-the-trolley routine, serving chai and  answering the questions over and over again. I refuse to. I promised myself I  wouldn&rsquo;t do it again after the last family.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;But  they are coming strictly to see you!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Well,  then, tell them I am busy. I just won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Wait  till your father gets home and I tell him. He has spoiled you.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ma,  I can&rsquo;t, I have a study group you know that.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Well,  then, cancel it!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;And  fail?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes!  I don&rsquo;t know why your father has planted this germ of seeking education into  your head? Mark my words, you can collect a chest full of degrees but if you  remain single, you will be taunted for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Well  I can handle that. At least I won&rsquo;t be a commodity pushing a trolley out in  front of picky strangers!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Fine,  then don&rsquo;t! Do as you please! I am tired of women all around the family asking  me why you are still single and don&rsquo;t get proposals. If you want to be  stubborn, do as you please.&nbsp; I will live.  If you don&rsquo;t care about your parents, go ahead.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Ok,  fine Ma! Just this once! But if they turn out like all the rest, I am no longer  serving chai in hopes of proposals.&rdquo; </em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  fine. I promise you it will be different this time. She sounded very nice. Did  I tell you he is doing his Master&rsquo;s in </em><em>America</em><em>? She did not seem uneducated like the last  one. This may actually be good for you. You come out wearing that satin green  kurta we stitched for Eid, and there is no way any mother in her right mind  would turn down my daughter for their son. He may be smart and intelligent but  my Bushra is no less.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh!  Stop Ma! Don&rsquo;t get your hopes high yet.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Ok,  and please stop going out in the sun so much. It has darkened your complexion  even more. Go now fetch some milk and lemon juice.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Ma,  please my skin won&rsquo;t change and neither will my nose, nor my smile, not even&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh,  just stop, give me a chance darling. These herbal remedies have worked since  your grandmother&rsquo;s time. I will ask Imran to take you to college on his  motorbike. He is your brother, after all. I am sure he also sees that all this  waiting for buses in the sun has made your skin way too dark. And please don&rsquo;t  come out wearing those damned eye-glasses this time! I will talk to your  father. I think he has some money saved from last month&rsquo;s lecture. We will go  get you contact lenses. They do miracles&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &hellip; She picked up the emptied teacups next. One by one. Each with its own  shade of lipstick kissing its rim. Shocking pink, cherry red and cocoa brown.  Lips she hoped were smiling at her when pasted on edges of cups like  indifferent sighs. She wondered how <em>chai</em> tasted after years of drinking it every evening and in every lounge. She didn&rsquo;t  know. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As a young girl, not so slim, not so fair, and not so striking, she was  told not to drink tea by her cautious mother because <em>chai</em> was dark and would only enhance the brown in her skin.&nbsp; So she didn&rsquo;t. The same way she agreed not to  play out in the sun as often as the boys. But now, in her late twenties, her  skin was still as brown as the dark of chocolate. The black of night. The  complexion synonymous with poverty, she could not help but wonder. Who decides?  She did not know, but once again she did not question. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Teabags, as plump as herself, dangled along the edge of polished  porcelain. Were they curvaceous or just plain obese? And when does a female  frame border between a voluptuous figure to unattractive fat? Did her own  silhouette resemble the pudgy tea bags or was she still considered just  tastefully healthy. All she knew was that between the demands of her mothers  and the sniggering of skinny and fair girls who fanned their faces with hands  that bore engagement rings and pronounced the word &lsquo;fianc&eacute;&rsquo; as if each syllable  was to be crooned; she would never know. <em>Maybe</em> that&rsquo;s why she abhorred the company of her own shadow. The irregularity of its  shape with its dark tint was like a mirror that accompanied and daunted her. A  walking companion she knew she could do without. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So she washed each cup carefully and then scrubbed the daisies on the  saucers as if to wash away their trace with water so warm, it wrinkled the tips  of her fingers into fleshy raisins. Fat and now unwanted teabags, she discarded  them with apathy in the garbage. The tea-pot and the china all rinsed clear, as  if tea had never browned their insides. Her fleshy raisins remained the same  color, however. Fingers she avoided fanning herself with or even running  through her hair during class; where she surrendered to smug diamonds which  scraped against every other skin but hers. The flesh of her own pinky to her  thumb, still bare.&nbsp; </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But every now and then there would be a call from a strange woman who  wanted to come over for tea. And <em>hope</em> that Nido &ndash; or his mother - would not notice her complexion, her nose, her body  or her eyes but present her with her own diamond &ndash; even silver would do &ndash; so  she, too, could join the club. She, too, could wave back at peers and aunts,  and she, too, could enjoy the exclusive thrill of uttering the word &lsquo;fianc&eacute;&rsquo;. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Salaam.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh,  you must be Bushra! Leave the trolley over there. We drink tea later. Come sit  here by me. I am Mrs. Ashraf.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Are  you sure Aunty?&rdquo; </em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No,  no, I watch my figure. It grow very big, very fast! Come here. This is Nido&rsquo;s  Auntie and this is his young sister Sadia. She doing A-levels.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Salaam.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Look  at me&hellip; Very charming girl you are!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Thank  you!&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Look  look, Sadia, she is charming na? Very charming.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Thank  you.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;So  what you do my dear?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;I  am doing my Master&rsquo;s in literature&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Oh,  that is real good. I love Romeo and Juliet. I read it a lot. How romantic, na?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Yes,  it is Aunty.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;My  Nido love books too. All the time reading. All the time reading. But only  English books.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;That  is wonderful. I am majoring in Urdu literature, though, Aunty.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Urdu  literature? What for?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;I  believe that some of the finest writers were from this part of the world and  wrote in Urdu.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Oh,  ok. That is nice also. One should read everything. My Sadia is taking A-level  Urdu. She says it is an easy A. I say then take it.&rdquo; </em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  nice.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>&ldquo;What  else? I like your green dress&hellip; Very nice&hellip;very nice.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Thank  you Aunty. My mother and I stitched it for Eid last year.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;That  is good. We buy clothes ready made but stitching also well.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes,  it is.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Great&hellip;Ok&hellip;well&hellip;wonderful.&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Would  you like some chai now Aunty?&rdquo;</em></p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Yes,  please.&rdquo;</em></p> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;The cake had been put away. Back  in the fridge where it would now lie and rot. <em>Maybe</em> another piece would be sliced away to satisfy midnight hunger  pangs one night, and her mother would urge the rest of the household to finish  the rest because it was food and there were children in the world who didn&rsquo;t  get to enjoy such goodies. Children who did not get to eat biscuits &ndash; neither  salty nor sweet &ndash; or enjoy <em>chai</em> in  airy drawing rooms. Neither did they have to push out a trolley that carried  such treats. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;But the trolley was almost empty  now. Just a tiny plate of nuts to be put back into the jar and sealed shut. A  fistful of almonds to munch on. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Almonds. So dark on the outside yet milky white once they shed their  skin. Was she just as fair as an almond, hidden beneath a peel? Maybe just &ldquo;<em>charming</em>&rdquo; on the outside but truly  beautiful inside? That may have been the reason that Mrs. Ashraf gazed deep and  long into her skin with such conviction. Not because she was dark, but because  &ndash; like almonds &ndash; she exuded a beauty that would unearth once the layer of <em>charm</em> was scraped away. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As charming as the skin of almonds. The color of <em>chai. Charming</em> and all the cautioned subtlety that the compliment  entailed. Because of a dark complexion, she was not <em>pretty</em> or God forbid even <em>gorgeous</em>,  but simply just&hellip; charming.</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The trolley had done its deed. It had behaved itself and was now tired.  She was exhausted too. She thought of Nido&rsquo;s photograph and fantasized. Not  necessarily of lust or their first kiss or even the manly touch of a warm hand  on her flesh. But, just him and as much fantasy as the paper-flat photo could  muster. She could not tell if he was as tall as the men whom she usually found  attractive. Eyes concealed behind sunglasses, the color of his eyes were  impossible to decipher. Was he somber? Was he witty? Did his breath reek in the  morning? Did he snore? Was he a romantic like film heroes or just a heartbroken  college student in the west for whom female sexuality was no longer a mystery,  her nudity no longer a fantasy. Had he seen it all? </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Still dreaming of what he may be like, she sat in front of a trolley she  had now completely cleared up when her mother walked in and politely inquired  &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo;</p><p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slightly embarrassed by the  shameful thoughts that floated in her mind, with her mother still pacing  around, she whispered an answer: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bushra dear you looked beautiful  tonight.&rdquo; her mother smiled.</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you. I don&rsquo;t know though&hellip;she  called me charming. And I don&rsquo;t know if she was too pleased by the fact that I  am more fluent in Urdu than English.&rdquo; </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh who cares about that? You speak  wonderful English. I should thank Bhabi Sughra for thinking about us. Hopefully  they will propose.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But what if they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they? Everything went  so well.&rdquo; </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;He looks quite young. She said it  is a recent photograph. Nice looking boy isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t tell much. It&rsquo;s just  a bust shot.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at you, girls of today,  absolutely no shame. I didn&rsquo;t even see your father till our wedding night! Be  thankful for what you have.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t ask for my picture  though? What if their son doesn&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rubbish. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he? Anyway,  don&rsquo;t keep the phone busy, they may call in the next few days.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ma, now please don&rsquo;t rush at every  phone call like you did last time. They will call in their own time if they  want to propose. Ok?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So when am I chasing after the  phone? I am just saying don&rsquo;t keep the line busy. You know how your brother  spends hours calling up his friends. Don&rsquo;t worry, I will tell Imran to stay  away from the phone myself. Our phone should be available just in case they  call.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ok, ok.&rdquo;</p><p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alright dear, they are about to  air the last episode of &lsquo;<em>Tanha</em> <em>Khilari&rsquo;</em> on PTV. Switch the light off  when you come out and remember, tell Imran not to keep the phone busy for a  while.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bushra nodded and then shoved the trolley back into its corner. She <em>hoped</em> that the next time she would  beckon it out from that corner, it would not be for guests who were also  strangers. She was <em>hopeful</em>. She could  not help but <em>wish</em>. <em>Maybe</em> the next time the phone would ring  it would be Mrs. Ashraf requesting to stop by again. Or <em>maybe</em> even a husky voice of a man called Nido! </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For now, she was to go and watch a television drama full of gorgeous and  skinny damsels in between countless interruptions by commercials of bleach  creams and facial cleansers that guaranteed turning any female from just  charming to beautiful. </p><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Switching off the light, she walked out of the darkness wondering if the  phone would ring. She walked out with her own set of inevitable <em>hopes</em>, <em>wishes</em> and <em>maybes</em>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone did ring&hellip;.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they never called. </p>            <P></td>
