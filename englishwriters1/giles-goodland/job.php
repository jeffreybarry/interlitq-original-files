Black Ant <br><br>

Max Muller meets Max Miller<br>
Political body is a panzer division<br>
Grain thithers its motoreye<br>
The reichstags are disassembled<br> 
Uprise sailwinged from the pavings<br>
Light makes message across the dust<br>
Push drugs sleep well solve crimes fix bugs <br>
Do not lean on or out of the world <br>
Lost songs roll on the pavement<br>
I have captured the joyful aphids<br>
Their senses are minute<br>
Eyes build from pressurized shadow<br>
A particle of crack moves its clockwork<br>
Traffic pushing in the eye is arm of the state <br>
Seek the warble in the meat the flaw<br>
A tightening flame dreams my head open<br>
What is it that we are articles of<br>
Take apart the sand lyrics from the news<br>
City is what is underground<br>
Deep in our holes we celebrate mass<br>
Embody the paving’s stored energy<br>
Write our commentaries on the patio<br>
The road is the western eye<br>
Far-reaching end in itself is answerable to state<br>
The sentence all the time is the chain pulling <br>
We must farther a reductionary assembly-line<br>
Our sand pyramids are destroyed by cloud-gods<br>
Do not give more importance to mountain than to I<br>
An aphid sets the handgun to hazelight<br>
Forkforth the fellowfalling infobot<br>
A postFordist sphere is not private<br>
Startarnished semimetal is rustistant <br>
Tightbeltedly we clamber the scenetrail<br>
Unarrange the earthed colonists<br>
Dragoon the redactionary outgangs<br>
Flowers reproduce from ash<br>
The words spoken over the child swarm <br>
Avert eyes from man picking nose<br>
We are centaurs in the dragonworld<br>
Learn of the green world what can be place<br>
Think of the letter before A: we cannot know its shape<br>
Large woman walks small dog<br>
Do not stand in the hatched area<br>
Pheronomenon smells of language. <br><br><br><br>


Bedbug<br><br>

I was a penis in my previous wife<br>
committed derelictation of durty<br>
plumping a tormulted skinurge <br>
I cockscrewed my sensors in a thoughsand <br>
sweat nosethings with raspeyes and secret <br>
juices, minoture to an atomation<br>
my fecifork palpered<br>
as a postnatural folkdevil felched <br>
roseflesh in bat of the eyeless<br>
nudescending a stircease<br>
she slept open my head and afar <br>
voices when the door ajarred <br>
surmounted the furnurture <br>
scrawled over the coverletter<br>
I fleshened my hemispears into<br>
mouthhook to oilwell in limbage<br>
as my entined inslider or genital mouth<br>
in everesting faunication<br>
wounded the heel the bed mine-<br>
shafted into bitternest on the nerve<br>
injecutives rawfully tampering<br>
like exworkers in the exindustry<br>
by anthorn and andlelights<br>
benightly a pistonish alpdancer <br>
manchined the onanimal chinch <br>
to prick a crimped plastron<br>
with illwilling resistungs to emblody <br>
the grozet throne with blaeber and some<br>
thing in my dreams messed with me<br>
it showed me my wife’s new dick<br>
illicit suckler of gubernation that<br>
lovesickened the nightsweats <br>
secrept the wounderer these are the <br>
legintimate pictures blood makes as it <br>
drowns its godheaded hook against <br>
the fully amourtipped grindson full<br>
cocked and bedusted the entryways<br>
he who hinderstands the bedveil<br>
wanks in the moltel of the eyeclot. <br><br><br><br>

Six things must exist first: the desire, the leaf, organ of release, loss of knowledge, cloud-cover, a sturdy wormform, sleepclot. The shadow murmurs and you turn around to say pardon and see the massed forms of your enemies in streetlight. Step out of the cloud, big man, your song is the wrong size, read the Terms and Conditions.

Bot Fly<br><br>


Being time, this is my skin bullet, no nonsent is earsense composed of rings with a double row of acuminated teeth, undercarriage engaged—furnished with hooks, for taking hold of an inner coat formed of an oestrange substance, and inboxing four tubes o the shadow bursts from inside. Here it spends the winter, and the following summer, perceive this as fast, the action wronging in the eye, the pouring forth of sun when it is about an inch long, it disengages, and being carried through the intestines, burrows in the glowth; and changes into an oval black pupa with spiny amputands, from which, in some weeks, the perfect gilgamesh the godleaf the person sitting across from you is empty like a little tin pot. His name’s Pol Pot, he hurt a lot, can see our real shapes and straing the motable televiolin, distressing it very much by the annoyance which it gives in the whitish crown of the head unchanted, the thorax black, retractile within one another, like<br>
pieces of telescope; by means of this organ a hole is pierced in an ox's hide, the fly is elegleant in depositing her egg, not that the stalked figures are night they have openings for you and heave themselves past windows. Cattle exhibit excitement and rush about, quicklips stretched forward, tails stuck out, feeding upon juices beneath the skin, forming a sac within which it grows amidst purulent matter suited to its appetite; and from which it finally unmuzzles its further transformations in the ground. Blades appeared in memory that could tense the rain singign a xenagogue humisphere. It is of a grayish colour, with large head and yellow face, and is most abundant in damp woody mantracks. Sheep exhibit great alarm when it approaches them, and seem to seek, by throbbing their noses to the ground, and by incessant motion of feet, to keep it from their nostrils. Escape demolition only by growing. Ungum the moon, polish it so in the land where sand is<br>
kin to cloud, the poor animals run thither and thether, snorting and in great mentalmorphosis. The common saying, that a whimsical person is maggoty, or has maggots in his walmart, perhaps arose from the freaks the sheep exhibit when infested by bots. We are insists applying rain to the fingers we have buzzed out of the sluices of his mouth open that which is fed, a feeding a simple dream to distress from. It is in the floundress of the sheep that this fly selfseals, and the lipletters, when hatched, make their way into sinuses, I found movement under my skin since overtaken on the tongue’s slipway feeding upon the juices, until they are ready to change into betterflies, her who hisitates is list, when they find their way again through the nostrils to the sleepage. These larvae move with considerable dirigibility, holding by mouthhooks, and contracting and elongating skinflakes following collapse of stout party the publicsphere regurges into an
