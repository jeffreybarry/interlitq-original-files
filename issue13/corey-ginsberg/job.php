              <strong>Like When we Were Together</strong></p>
            <p>Across the miles of booth at the Denny&rsquo;s in downtown Lauderdale, we chew through<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fluctuating iterations of silence. And I think how it&rsquo;s not really all that different <br>
            than when we were together, when your idea of a date was sex, then a cheeseburger, than sex. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, not even a cheeseburger. </p>
            
            <p>You&rsquo;re eating with your mouth open and I try to pretend it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I did when we were together. Maybe you&rsquo;re trying to pretend, too, that I&rsquo;m not<br>
            judging you, like maybe you pretended I wasn&rsquo;t judging you when we were together.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You really blew it, didn&rsquo;t you? I don&rsquo;t mean that as a judgment, but I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
           
            <p>it in case you truly want to make yourself a better person and know that hearing someone <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you once, and maybe still care about, point this out, might jump-start<br>
            your broken motor. But not like the broken motor of my VW Beetle you jumped junior year, <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you wired it backwards and it fried my engine.  I never even yelled at you </p>
            
            <p>about that. Perfect GRE math score or not, you shouldn&rsquo;t be in charge of real-world things, let alone <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a relationship. Not that you were in charge of our relationship. I don&rsquo;t know <br>
            that I was, either. This could be why our captainless boat belly-upped. We floated along together<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for too long, like that stray piece of lettuce on the ocean of your face you somehow don&rsquo;t notice.</p>
           
            <p>Why the hell can&rsquo;t you feel it there, to the side of your upper-lip stubble, the pile of whiskers <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to ask you to shave because they gave me cheek rash? I want to pick it off your face, <br>
            but don&rsquo;t owe you any insider hints, you numb manlump. You never made it easy for me. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that, right? There could have been heads of lettuce stuck to my face, </p>
           
            <p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed. Imagine the lettuce being haircuts, new shirts, ear piercings, that time <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got two hundred dollars worth of blonde highlights and all you had to say was &ldquo;Your hair.&rdquo; <br>
            Well, you fucker, what would you have done If I&rsquo;d have said, &ldquo;Oh, your penis,&rdquo; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and left the rest up to the syntax unpacking gods, who clearly shunned our conglomeration </p>
            
            <p>of misspent Sundays? Why talk when there&rsquo;s sex, even if sex it&rsquo;s as sloppy as a blind dentist <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performing a root canal with a spork? Why talk about anything, when there&rsquo;s all this meaty silence for me to unpack and you to ignore? <em>How&rsquo;s your mother? Good. Glad to hear. Yes, yes, </em><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>hmmm. Uh huh . . . </em>I ask. But within five minutes, it crescendos into the same old fight</p>
            
            <p>about why I hate agnostics and why you hate the Beatles, why  Roger Waters was <em>the one,</em><br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but John Lennon was a degenerate sellout. I feel the familiar hot hefty hate slather itself <br>
            onto the tips of my tone, warp my best intentions for this one last lunch get-together,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the conversation digresses from our six common friends and the ugly babies they&rsquo;re having </p>
           
            <p>to why you still think I&rsquo;d look better if I wore my hair down, then climaxes with why it&rsquo;s okay <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you blackmailed your boss out of nearly a hundred grand and yet we&rsquo;re going Dutch at Denny&rsquo;s.<br> 
            How do you see things, from your spot across the booth? Are you looking past the napkin you just blew <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your nose into, then set next to your Sprite glass? Or is your slovenly situation </p>
            
            <p>off-putting, even to you? Speaking of off-putting, what makes you so sure I want to know <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about your new girlfriend and how she puts out on weeknights, sometimes twice on Monday? <br>
            I care about her tits and thongs approximately one eight as much as I cared about game theory <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that night we got stoned and you launched into a two-hour math manifesto. </p>
            
            <p>Sometimes I want to strangle you, my three-year trainwreck, my perpetual could-have-been. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I imagine burying your body in an unmarked grave <br>
            in a parking lot of a J.C. Penny&rsquo;s, next to a beautiful park, only the locals built a wall around it <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you can&rsquo;t see from your asphalt casket beneath the handicapped spot you always parked in </p>
           
            <p>because walking to the food court for a big fucking piece of Sbarro&rsquo;s pizza from four rows back <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a cataclysmic undertaking, akin to doing laundry and dishes during the same weekend, <br>
            to brushing and flossing, to peeing and flushing. I spent thousands of moments of lost time with you, <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all those untapped Thursdays after my night class, spilling into splotchy, starving weekends. </p>
           
            <p>All I have to show for our time together is this doggy bag full of pasta primavera, and the bread you <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discarded because you&rsquo;re the only person I&rsquo;ve ever met who doesn&rsquo;t like bread. In the parking lot, <br>
            we lock in a robotic, Tin Man embrace, and I wonder if the passersby know that sometimes I fantasize<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about plucking you from the banks of my brain, and other times, about what we&rsquo;d name our kids.<br>
