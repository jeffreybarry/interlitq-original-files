              <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
              <p> Tsvetanka Elenkova&rsquo;s father was the  internationally renowned opera singer Stefan Elenkov, which means from an early  age her ears were exposed to the intricacies of music. So the poems in this  selection, all taken from her latest collection, <em>The Seventh Gesture</em> (<em>Sedmiyat  jest</em>, 2005), resemble musical phrases, a baton or wand she picks up to  conduct a motif, express magic, ending on the dominant (to our satisfaction) or  hauntingly, in mid-air, like the carriage taking us from the opera house, which disappeared on the stroke of midnight and we came down with a bump. Poems that,  when typed and revised, were all seven lines long, the eighty-four poems in the  book (and the others). Not only that. The poems are actually seventy-seven,  plus seven (an epilogue of the days of Creation). When I translated the poems  on to the screen, they were also seven lines long, though Time and a choice of  fonts has put paid to that. Our imagination is also piqued by the preponderance  of the definite article, the rat-a-tat effect Bulgarian is famous for, leaving  us to wonder what exactly these rivers, stones, were she refers to as <em>the</em>.

			 <p> Tsvetanka  Elenkova&rsquo;s gesture is, while we observe the body, to show us a detail or, while  we pick out a route, to take us down the middle (where we thought there was a  barrier and we couldn&rsquo;t go). This is what sets her poetry apart &ndash; three  collections to date including <em>The Stakes  of the Legion</em> (1995) and <em>Amphipolis  of the Nine Roads</em> (1998) &ndash; and has led to her poetry being published abroad  in fifteen countries, from Argentina  to Hungary to Turkey.</p>

            <p><strong>IN THE SCHEME OF THE COSMOS</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">When you enter the track, keep  going. Don&rsquo;t stop at every station. Be like an express, like a water-slide, but  not at its beginning and end. Your speed must be measured. That&rsquo;s why there are  tunnels, covered water-slides. So that you don&rsquo;t fly off. Except for birds,  only aeroplanes can fly &ndash; and <em>spiders</em>.  Not trucks for lifting cars, but which drop from the ceiling to the floor of  our rooms. They make their own tracks and these are invisible. That&rsquo;s why we  talk about flying. Even birds follow a path. In the scheme of the cosmos.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>ILLNESSES</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">As the moon raises the oceans, so  illnesses come with their younger sisters, pains. From beyond. Forces that  gather our bodies, organs, beat them and lay them out again. As a tornado the  fences, houses and trees. The following morning the earth dishevelled, the  earth ill with measles. As winter grit dashes against our faces in summer. And  they burn as in a fever. And then people go out, sweep the yards, wash their  hands and build fires. This is how earthquakes happened. With a drill on the  teeth and without anaesthetic.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>PASSPORT PHOTOS</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Those severed heads in photos are  not as horrific as in films. Although they&rsquo;re of our nearest and dearest and we  carry them in our bags, sleep with them on the bedside table, talk to them. In  the gloom of the church they are not horrific either &ndash; they say it&rsquo;s a holy  place, far from all violence. It must be the lack of blood, but for the past  and future. Only one with the crown of thorns and the closed-open eyes  frightens me. Observing me from every angle. Only the woman who died in a car  accident with a photo of Our Lady in her bag.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>COLOURS ARE LAID IN THE DARK</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">At the beginning of every film, as  at the end, there are several black frames where it is joined to the cartridge  and to the spool of the camera so that it can rewind, so that it isn&rsquo;t exposed.  While in the cartridge, the whole film is black. If it has advanced and you  open it in the light, it also turns black. So sensitive on the road to Damascus or some other  city. Colours are laid in the dark only with measured light. As much as filters  through a straw hat or a pair of sunglasses. A flash. And when it&rsquo;s processed  we look at the pictures.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>MY SON&rsquo;S NIGHT EYES</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">They say that windows are the eyes  of houses but through some it&rsquo;s difficult to look in. Rain-spattered, poorly  washed, with frosted flowers or scratched. Others with paint from the frames.  However, I remember one evening, when the curtains were not yet drawn, they  became a mirror. What they reflected on the inside they let out, sleek and  opaque with that indeterminate colour of a reptile&rsquo;s body &ndash; or better of its  skin, cast next to a stone. Like the difference in houses reflected in the  water of a single harbour at two separate times.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>THE SPARK IN US</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">There is a wire between the thighs  and palate. A wire on which the organs are hung like laundry. Trousers with  their two legs, corsets, handkerchieves of various sizes. In a gust of wind the  line comes undone and they all fall down. There is a wire that conducts  electricity, and at each end a small tongue. Sometimes there&rsquo;s a short circuit  and the electricity board sends someone out. They open the door of the meter  affixed to the wall, check the seals, you pay up. If you do not wish to pay,  they lay your wire underground.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>LIKES ATTRACT</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">The comb was indented from too much  combing. Its teeth thinning. Because the hair was thick and difficult to comb.  The hair was indented from too much combing. Its strands thinning. Because the  hair was thick and difficult to comb. First the comb, then the hair were  thinning. In the photograph they look so alike. Bone comb. Brown hair. Bunches  at the side, white with age. Sharp-pointed with a parting in the middle,  dividing them into two equal parts. Thick or sparse hair. Electrified. Like the  comb.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>WHEN THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, EVEN THE GODS ARE SILENT</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Even if the gods are silent, I will  trust you again. Like rape covering the fields of central Europe.  Which no one sees or knows about, except for the farmers. But from an  aeroplane, for example, you can sweep it all with a single glance. Even if the  gods are silent, I will trust you again, like oil drawn from this same rape &ndash;  which is not sunflower oil or olive or vegetable or palm. Even if I haven&rsquo;t  tasted it, I will take after it, its yellow blossom &ndash; which is not gold or  sickness. So low but from above so lush.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>THE TIME WE ARE TOGETHER</strong> </p>
            <p align="justify">In the time we are not together,  time sinks. Like a pressed piano key. Even though it emits tone, music. In the  time we are together, time is silence. You do not even press the right-hand  pedal, which doesn&rsquo;t give out a sound but sustains it. The time we are together  is silent. Our hands interlocked as for prayer. You&rsquo;ve already written the  words I wanted to say to you. And I will write the words you have to hear. The  time we are together is so silent in our absence you can hear only the rustle  of one or two <em>leaves</em>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>OSIRIS AND ISIS</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">As I see it, so scattered among us  all &ndash; a suddenly broken necklace or spilt rice &ndash; so shattered &ndash; crystal on  tiles, glass from a stone &ndash; I think that we serve it, not the other way round.  Or it also served us, but before it dispersed &ndash; drops of mercury or sand. We  took our temperature with it, decorated our shelves, our necks, ate. Now we  sweep it up, wipe the floor and rinse the cloth. That&rsquo;s all. &lsquo;In any  situation,&rsquo; I say to my son, &lsquo;wear slippers and wash your hands. For a piece  not to lodge in you.&rsquo; Of the Word.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>I WANT YOU EXHAUSTED</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">I want you exhausted like a blue  cloud which has just stopped raining, like a mature brandy, like a snail whose  shell has been broken, which ever so slowly descends a steep slope, like  laundry which dried long ago, like an old woman&rsquo;s mottled hands, I want you  exhausted like a blue cloud hanging over me, as I wait at a red light and a  warm spring breeze rises, melting the snow, sifting the leaves, and we sit in  short sleeves at the caf&eacute; tables, I want you exhausted like a sliced liver.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>BY THE CROWN OR ROOTS</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">&lsquo;A tree can wither by the crown or  roots,&rsquo; my grandmother used to say, seated in a wheelchair, sheltered from the  sun and wind. Some people in their cars career into the wind and sun, sunroof  open, windows down, hands hanging out, thumping music, wheelchair sent flying.  Slam on the brakes, skid marks, blow a tyre. And yellow in the pants, around  the mouth, on the nose, as if you had smelt a flower. &lsquo;A tree can wither by the  crown or roots,&rsquo; my grandmother used to say, &lsquo;or by both at once.&rsquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>POEMS&rsquo; FUNERAL</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Like a sudden whirlwind, poems come.  Like lightning far off in the sky but touching the earth. And always caught in  a season. The flurry of leaves, the short circuit with the wet grass. You know  that they&rsquo;ve been from the swept yards, from the flattened clover, from the  scent of coriander. Sometimes you can even trace their tracks &ndash; two skid marks  from slamming on the brakes, two cart-ruts in the mud lane. And a procession of  people at the rear. And poems have their funeral.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>THE KNOTS OF WINDS</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Some things are like the inner  threads of a shirt &ndash; frayed because we&rsquo;ve worn it a lot &ndash; and others like the  outer &ndash; they don&rsquo;t rub against our body but are damaged from the outside. Or  when we wash them unreversed. We bear them, a sack of gifts or cross on the  shoulder. Non-stop Christmases and Easters. We untie them but in fact they tie  us, we hand them round but in fact they gather us, and vice versa, as if linked  like a flowerpot with a pail of water when we&rsquo;re not at home. Or the knots of winds  that gather only on deck.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>SWEETNESS IS IN THE SUN</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Sweetness is in the sun, bitterness  in the soil. Like cucumbers, whose roots are not edible by late autumn. Unless  you pickle them. Like apricots, peaches, cherries (those black ones) &ndash; what  need of toffees? The taste of a tanned body before you&rsquo;ve gone for a dip in the  sea, before you&rsquo;ve sweated on the road to the beach, early in the morning or in  the gloaming, when you half-close your eyes, suck me, rend me with your  fingernails, to get at the stone, this sun half over the hills.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>SLAUGHTER</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">We&rsquo;re caves and run inside. Whether  it&rsquo;s raining out or dry. We always run inside. Even more forcefully when  torrents come. The underground rivers are many, I cannot count them all. Every  single one salty. As is clear from the stalactites and stalagmites. From the  white rocks. Rocks, did I say? They shred like Easter cakes. Stratified. We run  most in the corners, where the jaws, the clavicles, join. And this smell of  dampness, and this blackness, only thin out at the entrance. Bristle, which you  scrape off with a knife.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>SELF-SACRIFICE</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Inside I smell of the taste of  earth. Earth that a child bites, having fallen flat on its face. Earth that in  the east they sprinkled their heads with in sadness. Earth that alone flies in  the mouth, left over from winter, from the dusty summer, in the first spring  days. I refuse to swallow it. I&rsquo;m even afraid. I spit at length in the street,  a smoker, I spit, although it&rsquo;s not the done thing. I rinse my mouth. But I  still smell of earth, a scrap of food lodged between two of my teeth. I probe  it at length with a toothpick, till it bleeds.</p>
