              <p>Groucho Marx&rsquo;s well-known witticism &lsquo;Why should I care  about posterity? What&rsquo;s posterity ever done for me?&rsquo; has a long history. Joseph  Addison, in the early eighteenth century for instance, couches it as: &lsquo;We are  always doing something for posterity, but I would fain see posterity do  something for us.&rsquo; And that somewhat cantankerous relationship with posterity  occurs in a good many examples over time.  Fears about posterity - its power, its judgments, its forgetfulness -  are not new, though perhaps the level of present guilt is so. There has always  been the view that posterity can take care of itself. After all, posterity has  the last laugh. It usurps us. Why should we serve it? Statesmen and politicians  worry about their legacy &ndash; how they will be written into history. The judgment  of posterity in such cases often throws a lurid light back upon the present,  indeed<em> is</em> of course, simply a  camouflaged judgment by the present.</p>

            <p>The two dictionary definitions of posterity point up  contrasted ways of imagining the future. In one definition, posterity is the  single stream of issue from one forebear, with a legalistic tinge. This is how  wills are written. In the other, we find a broadcast inclusiveness: posterity  is all human generations that come after us. There may be tension between these  two imaginings. Posterity can be the most selfish or the most disinterested of  ideas generated out of present conditions: &lsquo;to secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and  our posterity&rsquo; &ndash; the opening sentence of American constitution: &lsquo;our&rsquo; posterity  here is national: who did it include? Who are &lsquo;we&rsquo;? &ndash; white American males  only, or all American citizens, and what  of the slaves?</p>
<p>If we lived for ever there  would be no posterity, so death is intrinsic to the concept. But it is also a  way of thwarting death. Both individually and communally our lives persist into  the future through posterity. Yet posterity is always ghostly, unimaginable. It  is a bank in which we put provisions for an after-life of sorts. But we shall  never be able to withdraw our savings. We cannot <em>know </em>posterity. It is more remote than progeny, a coming-after when  we are not. It is more severe than children, more public than family.</p>
<p>Exactly for that reason it has been the resource of  those who feel under-appreciated by their contemporaries. The nineteenth-century awkwardly prophetic  writer Samuel Butler, for instance, remarks that if you write for posterity you  are bound to be misunderstood in the present. In writing for posterity you may  be writing solely for yourself. The notion of posterity justifies what is simply  an ideolect. Your peers can&rsquo;t challenge  posterity. The artist, or the politician, can claim renown, delayed. So &lsquo;posterity&rsquo;  has been an important trope for poets since the Renaissance and in the Romantic  period. It can be boast or defence. </p>
Posterity fuels  poetry, and literature puts posterity back into the present, yes. But posterity  has changed its significance for us since Darwin  intervened, or so I&rsquo;ll suggest later.</p>
            <blockquote>Not marble nor the gilded monuments<br>
              Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme;<br>
  But you shall  shine more bright in its contents<br>
              Than unswept stone, besmear&rsquo;d with sluttish time.<br>
              When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br>
              And broils root out the work of masonry,<br>
              Nor Mars his sword nor war&rsquo;s quick fire shall burn<br>
              The living record of your memory.<br>
  &lsquo;Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<br>
  Shall you pace  forth; your praise shall still find room,<br>
              Even in the eyes of all posterity<br>
              That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br>
              So, till the judgment that yourself arise,<br>
              You live in this, and dwell in lovers&rsquo; eyes. (sonnet  55)</blockquote>
            <p>In this Shakespeare sonnet, posterity and poetry  combine to keep the lover alive. She or he is not yet re-embodied, as at the  last judgment, but <em>re-made</em> in the  actual reading of these strong words: the beloved is recognised by future  lovers and held in their gaze. Here posterity remains in the future, vouching  for the excellence of the lover, but the experience is authentic because we have  it now, in the moment of reading. Something yet more strange happens in  Shelley&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
              In his &lsquo;Defence of Poetry&rsquo; (1819) Shelley imagines  poets as the mirrors that catch the future and make it already part of the  present. Posterity needs poets as a fulcrum or hinge with the present, and the  poets, unknowing, re-make in advance the laws by which human beings live. The  essay ends thus:</p>
            <blockquote>Poets are the hierophants  of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which  futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand  not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the  influence which moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators  of the world.</blockquote>
            <p>Poets are not so much harbingers as sounding boards  for the future. They are not <em>knowingly</em> in league with what is to come, but they realise it <em>unwittingly</em> in their work. This emphasis on the prophetic power of  poetry also insists that it realises its prophecy <em>in the present</em>.</p>
              <p>Not all poets figure posterity in this high guise.  Wordsworth claimed that he delayed publication of his great poem &lsquo;The Prelude&rsquo;  until after his death in order to provide funds for his posterity &ndash; his  children were to live on the proceeds of this freshly revealed masterpiece.  Undoubtedly he had other reasons too, to do with the constant revising of the  poem that accompanied his life, but the practical insistence on funding his  progeny chimes well with one view of posterity: we are responsible for making provision  for those who come after, whether they be our own offspring or not. Indeed, in  much ecological argument now, that responsibility is emphasised.
                </p>
            
              <p>Posterity in the work of present-day writers is often  dire. It is the bleak authoritarian time and community of Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s <em>Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> or, perhaps even more  threatening, of a world destroyed and engineered in her <em>Oryx and Crake</em>. It is the post-catastrophe world of Doris Lessing&rsquo;s <em>Memoirs of a Survivor</em> (though that  work ends with a move into tender impossibility). It is also the liminal world  where death and life, past and present and future, leak into each other in  W.G.Sebald&rsquo;s <em>Austerlitz:</em>
                </p>
              
              <blockquote>I feel more and more as if time did not exist at all,  only various spaces interlocking according to the rules of a higher form of stereometry, between which the  living and the dead can move back and forth as they like (p.261)</blockquote>
            <p>Or is it, rather, here, that there is no room for the  future, so dense is the traffic between present and past? Sebald knows, who  more profoundly, that the future cannot be descried, or described, that  catastrophe is insidious in its oncoming and that the childlessness of the  solitary survivor expresses the expunging of a people. In such circumstances,  after the Holocaust, the thought of posterity and of future generations seems  to provoke despair as often as it provides hope.</p>
              <p>Will posterity be very different from us? Even if we  continue to look alike we may not be alike. In &lsquo;Heredity&rsquo; Thomas Hardy gives a  voice to the family face:</p>
            <blockquote>
              I am the family face;<br>
              Flesh perishes, I live on,<br>
  Projecting  trait and trace<br>
              Through time to times anon,<br>
              And leaping from place to place<br>
              Over oblivion.</blockquote>
            <p>But that face gives no assurance of recognition.&nbsp; The conditions of life change life, yes. So  people&rsquo;s judgments and the forms of their desires are likely to change. But the  passions of the infant surviving in each of us are recalcitrant to change. <em>Those infantile passions may be our one  kinship and continuity with posterity.</em></p>
            <p><em>Posterity is a secular  concept. It involves no transcendence, though it frequently includes the hope  of improvement.</em> In eschatological systems such as Marxism its role is to provide hope,  as if wisdom may be further accrued after revolution. In evolutionary theory  the power of the individual to produce progeny, with their promise of further  diversification through generations, signals at once the continuance and change  of particular species. Evolutionary theory does not allow us to look far into  the future. The processes of change within a long environment &ndash; itself composed  of so many competing needs and desires &ndash; are so multifactorial that there is no  telling what the outcomes may be. There is no long plan, no arc of teleology.  Looking back, indeed, as Darwin  insists, what we see is the vanishing of species, the collapse of history. <em>The opposite of posterity is extinction. And  extinction is ordinary, as Darwin  everywhere recognises:</em></p>
            <blockquote>of the species now living  very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the  manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number  of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no  descendants, but have become utterly extinct. (p395) </blockquote>
  &ndash; though in the final paragraph of the <em>Origin,</em> on the next page<em>,</em> he insists on the capaciousness of  survival and suggests a hierarchical activity for extinction: Natural  Selection[entails] &lsquo;Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-improved  forms.&rsquo; (396) In his late Autobiography Darwin  faced the extreme future, when the earth will grow too cold for life. He  mourned the passing of what he hoped would by then be much improved forms of  life, but he accepted its inevitability. Even posterity is a time-bound  concept.</p>
              <p>In the current nightmares of the future, posterity is  called in evidence against us. We have defiled, defaced, distorted, the  resources current in the world. Posterity will hold us to account and condemn  us &ndash; if posterity survives to do so. Posterity <em>may</em> do so. But posterity probably won&rsquo;t think about us very much.  It will be preoccupied with its own concerns, and will take for granted the  conditions in which it finds itself. It will, after all, be the present. So I  disagree with the frequently expressed view, that without hope for posterity  life becomes bleak and society self-destructs. </p>
              We may feel concern for posterity, but we can scarcely  love it. It is the present we inhabit where love is felt. Literature and other arts can make portable  that present, taking what was past into the future, realising it in the  shifting now. I don&rsquo;t deny that we may  be squandering the future in our present behaviour. But those future  generations will live out their time in an environment more probably changed  than obliterated, and one that we cannot foresee. We may do our best, but we  shouldn&rsquo;t imagine that we can control what is to come, or that we shall be much  remembered for good or ill in those changed times.</p>
