           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American literature has always prided  itself on responding to conditions of modernity, on breaking up calcified  cultural traditions and establishing new modes of representation that might  better reflect an evolving world.  Looking back over his artistic and editorial career in 1912, William  Dean Howells proudly aligned himself with a rejection of ossified aesthetic  practices: &ldquo;Literature,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which was once of the cloister, the school,  has become more and more of the forum and incidentally of the  market-place.&rdquo; It is, though, one of the  curiosities of the present day that the liberal version of the United States which  became institutionalized in the second half of the twentieth century, and which  is still reflected today in the novels of luminaries such as Philip Roth and  John Updike, continues to exert such a strong hold on the popular  imagination. Roth&rsquo;s powerful fictional  accounts of recent American history exhibit disdain for what he takes to be the  vulgarizing influences of mass culture and ways in which such degrading forces impact  upon the existential sensibilities of his heroes, yet Roth&rsquo;s novels are still  regarded, especially in Europe, as an incisive account of American life in the  first decade of the new millennium. But,  as we see from novels such as <em>The Plot  Against America</em>, Roth&rsquo;s creative imagination is still anchored primarily in  the Second World War and its aftermath, and it has little interest in  addressing ways in which the United States in the twenty-first century has been  forced to accommodate forces that exceed the epistemological premises of what  Roth called, in the title of one of his books, &ldquo;American Pastoral,&rdquo; that old  notion of America as a privileged location, a world set apart. Contemporary American literature is necessarily  repositioning itself amidst a welter of transnational forces: international  terrorism, global warming, industrial outsourcing, the instability of financial  markets, and so on. American literature  in the twenty-first century is thus becoming a very different kind of animal  from its twentieth-century predecessor, one that follows the Howells principle  of responding to changing circumstances, but which is veering away  significantly from the model of American singularity and exceptionalism that  the generation of Roth and Updike tended to take for granted.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Roth, the  fiction of Jonathan Franzen takes the new worlds of computer science and global  media as givens, but then seeks to open up spaces within these abstract grids  of information technology where human emotion and identity can be  explored. Whereas many versions of  American pastoral going back through the nineteenth century sought to create a  protected space from which technological progress was simply excluded&mdash;one thinks,  for example, of Sarah Orne Jewett&rsquo;s stories of the 1890s, set in rural Maine&mdash;Franzen  rejects such a notion of retreat.  Instead, he attempts to render a more complex version of contemporary  life, one that opens up crevices within the monolithic structures of corporate  America. The question Franzen thus  confronts is how personal authenticity might be articulated, even within a  global framework of structural displacement and irony. His novels deliberately make thematic  connections between the domestic and the foreign: for example, in <em>The 27th City</em> (1988), Franzen  starts with a map of &ldquo;St Louis and Vicinity&rdquo; as the frontispiece, and he goes  on to chronicle how the Missouri city was &ldquo;appalled&rdquo; when a  thirty-five-year-old woman serving as Commissioner of the Bombay police in  India was appointed as its new police chief.  In <em>The Corrections</em> (2001), the  gradual disintegration of a family unit in the Midwestern town of &ldquo;St Jude&rdquo; is  linked to the collapse of the dotcom boom and to turbulence in global financial  markets, with the scenes set in Lithuania enabling the hero, Chip Lambert, to  get a different perspective on family life in America: &ldquo;From a distance of four  thousand miles, everything he&rsquo;d left behind in the U.S. looked manageably small.&rdquo;  True to its academic provenance&mdash;Chip  starts his career teaching cultural theory at a college in Connecticut&mdash;<em>The Corrections</em> can be seen as a kind of  thesis novel, knowledgeably critiquing human relations to science and finance  while also intertwining the domestic and the international.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave Eggers,  less conspicuously theoretical in his orientation, began his career by taking a  degree in journalism from the University of Illinois, where his &ldquo;old school  teachers&rdquo; trained him to take &ldquo;facts very seriously.&rdquo; In 1998 he founded an independent publishing  house in San Francisco that puts out <em>McSweeney&rsquo;s</em>,  a quarterly literary journal to which his friend David Foster Wallace and  others contributed. Eggers thus came to  fiction relatively late, publishing his first novel, <em>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</em>, in 2000. Yet the true &ldquo;genius&rdquo; of this work is to have  updated the stylistic idiom of New Journalism for the television age. Fiction inspired by New Journalism, a genre pioneered  by Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer in the 1960s, sought to enliven the often stale  conventions of prose fiction by embracing within it vivid factual narratives  more typically associated with journalistic reportage, and <em>A Heartbreaking Work</em>, which chronicles the death of the narrator&rsquo;s  parents and his efforts to bring up his younger brother single-handedly,  similarly prides itself on its factual authenticity: indeed, the front cover proclaims  the book is &ldquo;based on a true story.&rdquo; As we know from the work of Paul John  Eakin and other critical studies of autobiography, all confessional narrative,  from Jean-Jacques Rousseau onward, is necessarily a retrospective fiction in  one form or another; but what is interesting about <em>A Heartbreaking Work</em> is the way it seeks to validate its own story  by repositioning it as the common property of an entire generation. Eggers deliberately reorients publishing  conventions, spoofing the copyright page and so on, to reinforce an urgent  sense that this narrative both exceeds the conventional boundaries of fiction  and is universally applicable: &ldquo;This can be about <em>you</em>! You and <em>your</em> pals.&rdquo; Eggers&rsquo;s innovative mode of  realism, in other words, lies in its aesthetic of interchangeability, the way  it presents the narrator as &ldquo;the common multiplier for 47 million,&rdquo; using the  image of a &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; to evoke the connective tissue that binds his  contemporaries together, and manipulating cultural memories of television as  the fulcrum upon which these common experiences turn. After the loss of their parents, the narrator  in <em>A Heartbreaking Work</em> talks of  recreating a surrogate family environment through TV simulation&mdash;&ldquo;I am making  our lives a music video, a game show on Nickelodeon, lots of quick cuts, crazy  camera angles, fun, fun, <em>fun</em>!&rdquo;&mdash;and  there are innumerable references here to specific television programs: <em>Blind Date</em>, <em>21 Jump Street</em>, <em>The A-Team</em>, <em>Flipper</em>, <em>Late Night with Conan O&rsquo;Brien</em>, <em>Veronica&rsquo;s  Closet</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and so on. There is also an extended scene where the  hero auditions for MTV's &ldquo;seminal program&rdquo; <em>The  Real World</em>, a reality TV series following the lives of a group of  cohabiting young people, which is said to be filming its next season in San  Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <blockquote>Everyone&rsquo;s seen the  show. We all despise it, are enthralled  by it, morbidly curious . . . is it because in it we recognize so much that is  maddeningly familiar? Maybe this is indeed  us. Watching the show is like listening  to one&rsquo;s voice on tape: it&rsquo;s real of course, but however mellifluous and  articulate you hear your own words, once they&rsquo;re sent through this machine and  are given back to you, they&rsquo;re high-pitched, nasal, horrifying. </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one level, <em>The Real World</em> functions reflexively as  an emblem of Eggers&rsquo;s characteristic style of televisual realism, where his own  family environment mirrors the surrogate family portrayed on the reality TV  show. Television aesthetics, which  typically present a scenario as if it were happening &ldquo;live&rdquo; (even when it  isn&rsquo;t), are predicated upon an illusion of immediate relay, and Eggers  reproduces this idiom by transferring his narrative into the slipstream of a  present tense, where the crossovers between human consciousness and the &ldquo;breezy  frivolity&rdquo; of &ldquo;limitless cable TV&rdquo; are both highlighted and counterpointed. In <em>Mistakes  We Knew We Were Making</em>, a supplement conjoined to the novel and operating  as what it calls a &ldquo;corrective appendix&rdquo; to it, the narrator talks about &ldquo;my  brain&rsquo;s 24-hour worst-case-scenario cable channel,&rdquo; as though he were  envisaging the events unfolding around him as a plotline from television. On another level, though, this electronic  community of sentiment serves to validate rather than ironize the integrity of the  narrator&rsquo;s emotions. In his  theoretically informed appendix, Eggers cites Mary McCarthy&rsquo;s <em>Memories of a Catholic Girlhood</em>, where  nostalgic recollection is intercut with McCarthy&rsquo;s own acerbic demystification  of the flawed nature of such recollections, as one of his literary models; but  in a still more abstruse section within <em>Mistakes</em> entitled &ldquo;Irony and Its Malcontents,&rdquo; Eggers employs a self-deprecatingly small  typeface to challenge theoretically the validity of an application of irony to  all &ldquo;contemporary cultural production&rdquo; by &ldquo;ag&eacute;d arbiters.&rdquo; The author&rsquo;s point  is that life is much more of a continuum, a mixed bag&mdash;as he says, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t  label our days Serious Days or Humorous Days,&rdquo; so why our art?&mdash;so that  austerely to categorize messy human emotions within a rigidly ironic framework  is ultimately to be excessively reductive and demeaning, &ldquo;akin to the  too-common citing of &lsquo;the Midwest&rsquo; as the regional impediment to all national  social progress (when we all know the &lsquo;Midwest&rsquo; is ten miles outside of any  city).&rdquo; Eggers thus seeks to validate the power of human sentiment, associating  this power of affect both with the much-maligned Midwest and also with the kind  of sentimental popular culture, associated with mass media forms, that became  the common property of the MTV generation.  Rather than representing the Midwest as a specific geographic region of  the United States, Eggers conceptualizes it as a democratic zone defined by its  distance from prestigious urban centres and by its openness to the circulation  of electronic sentiment.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appendix to <em>A Heartbreaking Work</em> specifically  declares that &ldquo;[t]rue community cannot be political,&rdquo; and it argues not for any  instrumental form of collectivism but for the &ldquo;warmth of other people, their  electricity.&rdquo; Eggers makes a point in this novel of playing up his Irish  Catholic background, and the communitarian strand in his work generally stems  more from a desire to connect with a secularized version of universal  consciousness, <em>urbi et orbi</em>, than  from any sectional or national politics.  His second novel, <em>You Shall Know  Our Velocity</em> (2002) attempts deliberately to unite domestic and global  through the madcap scheme of its protagonists, Will and Hand, to travel around  the world in a week, and though of course it is a particularly skewed and  partial view of the wider world that emerges here, nevertheless the sense of  curiosity about Senegal, Morocco, Estonia, and the various other places they  visit reinforces this putatively religious notion of a global &ldquo;communion of  souls.&rdquo; &nbsp;The narrator&rsquo;s travels bring  home to him the simultaneity of the global village: he watches a &ldquo;cable-access  comedy improv show&rdquo; in Estonia and a porno channel on TV in Egypt, and he  celebrates the way the Earth&rsquo;s &ldquo;endless chorus&rdquo; is linked to &ldquo;fiber optic cables,  the way they can hold all that information.&rdquo; &nbsp;But the novel also foregrounds the limits of  mediated representation: &ldquo;That Hand didn&rsquo;t know more about Morocco&mdash;that it was  green, for starters&mdash;demonstrated the great gaps in knowledge that occur when one  gets most of one&rsquo;s information from the internet.&rdquo; There is, then, a phenomenological grounding  to this escapade, an acknowledgement of the irreducible quality of place. As Eggers himself put it in an interview when  the novel appeared: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever believe anyone who says that the world&rsquo;s been  explored, there&rsquo;s nothing left to see, all that. I mean, have you driven through Wyoming? Wyoming just makes you weep. We&rsquo;re so lucky to have it, all of it.&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many of  his contemporaries, Eggers is more invested in the global politics of  environmentalism than in the predictable routines of U.S. party politics, and  his short story &ldquo;Your Mother and I,&rdquo; included in the collection <em>How We Are Hungry</em> (2005), entertains the  fantasy of inducing George Soros to buy the Amazon rainforest in order to  preserve it for the planet. Eggers&rsquo;s  remarkable 2006 novel, <em>What is the What:  The Autobiography of Valentino Achak Deng</em>, extends this concern with global  politics by ventriloquizing the voice of a refugee from the Sudanese civil war  who comes to live in Atlanta. Prefaced  by a map of Sudan and Ethiopia, <em>What is  the What</em> seeks deliberately to raise awareness about social and economic  conditions in Africa, and again it does so through a modified form of New  Journalism, whereby the real life story of Valentino is recast in fictional  form. Eggers admitted that he  experienced considerable difficulty in finding the right <em>modus operandi</em> for this book&mdash;&ldquo;whether it would be fiction or  nonfiction. After about eighteen months  of struggle with it, we settled on a fictionalized autobiography, in  Valentino&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo; Yet the powerful  effect of this hybrid form lies in its insistence upon its own authenticity,  the way it implicitly peels back its own layers of artifice to convey a  powerful illusion of historicity. Just  as <em>A Heartbreaking Work</em> validates its  presentation of human sentiment by erasing the boundaries between real life and  television, so <em>What is the What</em> dramatizes a sense of political urgency by linking the novel to its own website  (where the real-life story is continually being updated), and by pointedly  donating all the profits from the book to the Sudanese community.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this  presupposes a very different notion of authorship from that which we associate  with Roth or Updike, and also a very different understanding of the scope of  &ldquo;American literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rather than  deferring to the traditional mystique of the author, Eggers&rsquo;s work prefers to  position the writer as an amanuensis of the global community, a correlative to  the universal celebrity enjoyed by Princess Diana, whose death is  symptomatically honoured in <em>What is the  What</em>: &ldquo;It seemed the whole world knew this person named Diana, and if the  world knew her, the connection between the peoples of the earth was tighter  than I had imagined.&rdquo; When he moves to  the United States, Valentino finds himself living in the city which is also the  headquarters of CNN&mdash;a coincidence highlighted when, thanks to the patronage of  Ted Turner, the refugees of the &ldquo;Lost Boys&rdquo; foundation in Atlanta celebrate  their collective birthdays at the CNN Center. All of this testifies again to Eggers&rsquo;s  attempt to write an ostensibly transnational novel, one where the Sudanese  immigrants to the United States construct a virtual community among themselves  through e-mail, and where the fates of Africa and America are inextricably  linked together by the spectres of international terrorism and  politics&mdash;Valentino talks of &ldquo;the web of money and power and oil that made our suffering  possible&rdquo;&mdash;as well as by the tentacles of the global media. It would, of course, be easy enough to relate <em>What is the What</em> to more conventional  narratives of U.S. immigrant literature: Valentino hails the &ldquo;kaleidoscopic  possibilities&rdquo; of America, claiming that to live in the United States is to be  &ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; since, despite 9/11, the country offers &ldquo;lives of opportunity and  ease&rdquo; by comparison with the situation for his compatriots in Sudan. His panegyric here to the Statue of Liberty,  &ldquo;startling and far more beautiful than I thought possible,&rdquo; also emphasizes the  traditionalist element in the novel, whereby America is presented as a natural  force for good in the world. But it  would be reductive entirely to conflate this globalized perspective with the  state of narcissism&mdash;a narcissism both of famous individual writers, and of U.S.  culture in general&mdash;that typified self-conscious invocations of a &ldquo;voice of  America&rdquo; during the second half of the twentieth century, in Updike&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rabbit&rdquo;  sequence as well as Roth&rsquo;s historical fictions.  For Eggers in the twenty-first century, human rights themselves have  become a global commodity, circulating alongside electronic entertainment  networks, and his own serious work on behalf of non-profit organizations in San  Francisco is of a piece with his ethical aspirations to introduce into his  fiction a true planetary spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To relocate  American literature within a planetary context is not just to disturb the  customary demarcation of its territory, but also to challenge the conventional  epistemological framework upon which such territorial claims are grounded. In 1985, the Californian cultural critic  Donna Haraway published her influential &ldquo;Cyborg Manifesto,&rdquo; where  &ldquo;polymorphous&rdquo; information systems disrupt assumptions of &ldquo;organic holism&rdquo; by  introducing confusion about the parameters of mind and body. Similarly, the posthumanist aspects of Franzen  and Eggers subvert time-honoured assertions of American pastoral, the blithe  understanding of the protected American landscape as potentially redemptive and  regenerative, and introduce in its place a universalist dimension that renders  the relation between human beings and their location much more opaque. One of Eggers&rsquo;s stories, &ldquo;After I Was Thrown  in the River and Before I Drowned,&rdquo; is narrated by a dog, lending the story a  spirit of alterity, a vaguely otherworldly air, the same kind of ontological  displacement of human consciousness hypothesized in Haraway&rsquo;s work. As with Haraway&rsquo;s similar exploration of the  parameters of animal vision in her <em>Companion  Species Manifesto</em> (2003), itself a companion to her &ldquo;Cyborg Manifesto,&rdquo; the  permutations and negotiations among different levels of consciousness &mdash;machine/human/animal&mdash; introduce a kind of negative theology, where  what we do not (and cannot) know becomes just as important as what we are able  to recognize. In &ldquo;A Cyborg Manifesto,&rdquo;  Haraway explicitly takes issue with the nationalistic and anthropocentric forms  of pastoral celebrated by Leo Marx in <em>The  Machine in the Garden</em> (and subsequently endorsed by Roth in works such as <em>American Pastoral</em>) when she asserts: &ldquo;A  cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden.&rdquo; Instead, Haraway argues in <em>The Companion Species Manifesto</em>, all  &ldquo;connection&rdquo; is &ldquo;situated&rdquo; and &ldquo;partial&rdquo;: &ldquo;I believe that all ethical relating,  within or between species, is knit from the silk-strong thread of ongoing  alertness to otherness-in-relation.&rdquo; Otherness-in-relation would be a more  accurate description of how the fictions of Franzen and Eggers relate to the  external world than more conventional notions of territorial appropriation,  regional loyalty or national ownership.  Situating their narratives on the boundaries of the human and nonhuman, these  novelists describe a world where the &ldquo;virtual . . . leaks into actual,&rdquo;  rendering the older cognitive maps based on three-dimensional Euclidean  geometry anachronistic.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To subvert  conventional assumptions of American pastoral, however, is by no means also  simply to dissolve the phenomenological concept of a home country. One of the most striking things about  American writers in the MTV generation is the way they are concerned to draw  ethical extensions and connections between themselves and others without  referring these processes of mediation back, as writers in the earlier part of  the twentieth century did so compulsively, to a national form of  belonging. Familiar critical jeremiads about  the debilitating effects of globalization on the field of literary studies tend  typically to posit a binary opposition between the &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; effects of  global capital on the one hand and what Daniel T. O&rsquo;Hara calls &ldquo;the passionate  pleasure of being fully alive&rdquo; on the other.  But the mistake here is to imagine that ethics can only be the  prerogative of a liberal subject, an assumption that fails to take into account  the more complicated and variable ways in which global consciousness has  entered into the American cultural domain in the twenty-first century. The liberal perspective, however, cannot properly  account for the implications of the contemporary transition from a national to  a post-national environment, nor can it accommodate the complexity of the MTV  generation&rsquo;s engagement with alien dimensions.  One of the reasons Roth&rsquo;s later novels have been so successful in  critical terms is that they make reassuringly familiar assumptions about the  scope of national synecdoche, the ways in which a liberal subject might operate  as an emblem of the national body as a whole.  In the work of Eggers, by contrast, this national narrative is dissolved  into a different kind of ecosystem, one organized around the global flow of  information, where ethical affinities are grounded not in direct relations to  territory or patrimony but in more circuitous ways. Moreover, the evolution of broadcasting in  the United States, marking the transition from a rhetoric bound into the  circumference of national space to one encompassing a global marketplace, can  be seen as both an agent of, and a correlative to, these shifts in literary  consciousness. Developing from the  rigidly spatialized notion of suburbs positioned in a subordinate relation to  the metropolis during the postwar era, through the hydra-headed expansion of  electronic media that characterized the 1980s and 1990s, the American  conception of a &ldquo;homeland&rdquo; in the global twenty-first century embraces the  paradoxes of a post-9/11 state, where the phenomenological attachment to home  is enfolded within a homeland exposed to radically different technological  conditions, whose perimeters can never again be entirely self-regulating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
