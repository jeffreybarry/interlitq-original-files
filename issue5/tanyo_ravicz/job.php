              <br><em>You might think because we both went to Harvard we  were assured of an easy and rich destiny but it isn&rsquo;t necessarily so. Even in  college we were capable of pushing a point beyond conventional good sense,  maybe to make up for a certain social inconsequence. Neither one of us belonged  to the prep school set and we never bought into the ethnic lovefest that let  everybody who wasn&rsquo;t anybody puff themselves up. Like a lot of beautiful women,  Brenda reaped from her good looks a natural contempt for men, and said she fell  for me because I wasn&rsquo;t easily led by her. In the long run women often regret  the instability of a restless man, but she was still very young. For my part I  was amazed to learn from her, a churchgoer, that good and evil were concepts  some people still actually believed in, and I was enough of a scholar to want  to explore with her the dionysiac roots of Christianity.</em>

            <p><em>It&rsquo;s true our qualities didn&rsquo;t lend themselves to easy  corporatizing, and our romance included a heavy dose of us-against-the-world.  Blame it on her Catholic upbringing or my too-ideal individualism, but you get  to feeling crowded and dirtied by the culture. Her fable was God and mine  Selfhood, but either way life comes at you as a series of assaults.</em></p>
            <p><em>After medical school she could have pursued a regular  illustrious career on the East Coast or in Hawaii,  but she opted to do her residency in Alaska.  Maybe agreeing to go to Alaska  was her way of holding on to me, but she needn&rsquo;t have worried. I was madly in  love with her.</em></p>
            <p><em>You know the reasons people go. You know the reasons  they give: the deadening routines, the cruelties and compromises, day after  day, until you begrudge the day its morning. The crushing burdens of the Coach  purse and the Rolex watch. Too many cemeteries. Too many others with the power  to shape your destiny without having to win your respect.</em></p>
            <p><em>From the dream-defying deaths of the city, we chose  exile: deprived ourselves of what we had known in order to transcend what we  had become. We carried the future in our hearts and were happy to fly together  and not to stay and make war on the world.</em></p>
            <p><em>Seoul, Mexico City, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Cambridge,  New York, London, Madrid, oh, you beautiful cities, goodbye!</em></p>
            <p><em>In the heart of Alaska  we found a crevice in reality that opened straight up into heaven. We passed  those years hearing the pure tones of ice and snow and wind and sun. But we  remained man and woman. We heard the pure tones of new life, the laughter and  cries of a child, and of a second child. But we remained man and woman. And we  never quite knew how the dream ended, if it ended, or if we only exchanged one  dream for another.</em></p>

            <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free Bird</p>
            <p>I have come to  recover the lost survey lines on a parcel of state land which I intend to make  my own. Northwest gales confined me to Kodiak town for three days before a  Super Cub on floats was able to set me down in this bight on the north shore of  the island. The pilot saw treacherous-looking rocks looming under the water,  and not wanting to put a hole in his floats he actually landed me two miles  east of my goal in country he&rsquo;s more familiar with. Now that he&rsquo;s gone, I&rsquo;m  filled with cautious excitement, hoisting my pack and stepping across the  beach. The air is quiet and all the proportions of life seem altered. Up on the  cliffs there&rsquo;s the skeleton of a cabin, and the beach is strewn with the relics  of a boat wreck. Something I have noticed before in Alaska: what the human element loses in  eminence, it gains in tragic grandeur. Here is the rusty, barnacled box of a  diesel engine stamped Detroit, and here&rsquo;s a broken foredeck pierced  with hand-forged nails.</p>
            <p>I hike west, a  curious otter keeping pace in the shallows. Deer and bear have tracked the  beach&mdash;I am certainly not alone. The pebbles and coarse sand are spitted by  lines of black rocks and boulders thrusting down to the sea. Spruce trees grow  in checkered stands on the cliffs and on the mountains that run the length of  the peninsula. It&rsquo;s the fourth of October and the mountain slopes are yellow in  the sun.</p>
            <p>These are  strange shores to me, but I am nevertheless aware, tramping the rough strand,  of a peculiar thrill of homecoming, a fullness in my throat and chest. The Pacific Ocean is familiar to me from my childhood, as  familiar to me as a parent, but I haven&rsquo;t been back in many years, during which  years I was busy being made into a citizen, molded and sanitized according to  the prevailing notions. I was like that old diesel engine on the beach, passed  along to the stamping factories where a useful unit was to have been made of  me.</p>
            <p>Having rounded  a rocky point, I pause in the middle of the beach and survey the shoreline, the  shore curving inward to form a broad cove. This appears to be the place. Fresh  water spews from the cliff and fans down the beach to the sea. Ducks paddle  away into Wildwood   Strait. And that must be Salmonberry Island three miles yonder.</p>
            <p>I drink my fill  from the foaming pool at the beach head and stand back, gazing up at the  mountains. Alder thickets and clusters of spruce trees grow in dark, irregular  patches on the grassy yellow slopes. A waning half moon is up in the day sky  and reminds me to keep moving. Having climbed to the grassy clifftop, I compare  the views on all sides with what my map and aerial photo tell me. Yes, this is  the place.</p>
            <p>I venture  inland, the old survey map and a compass in one hand, a machete in my other  hand, a roll of surveyor&rsquo;s tape hanging from a carabiner in my belt loop, and  my pack and shotgun on my back. There is no path to speak of. The way ascends among  scattered Sitka  spruce trees, and a grove of cottonwoods descends to my right. To pace off  large distances on foot while holding a compass bearing in wild country, and  not to be diverted by every stump, gully, briar or noise in the shrubbery, and  then to locate at the far end the last traces of an earlier survey expedition,  hopefully not yet obliterated&mdash;a survey monument just three inches in  diameter&mdash;and to do all of this in bear country, the green-black mounds of bear  manure frequently materializing underfoot&mdash;it&rsquo;s a job that requires a certain  finesse. Earlier, on the beach, I had placed my foot beside the hind track of a  brown bear, and my foot, even enlarged by the dimensions of my hip boot, was by  far the loser in size. The rustling grass and dead fireweed are head high and I  can&rsquo;t see beyond the compass in my palm. Finally surrendering to my  apprehensions, I unzip my backpack and crank up the <em>Highway Rockers</em> tape. &ldquo;Highway Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Open Road&rdquo; and Lynyrd  Skynyrd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Free Bird&rdquo; are supposed to resound in a wide radius and announce my  presence to the brown bears, but the notes sound faint, the musical decibels  dissolve in the wind, and I find that the tape deck which at home within the  walls of our house generated a heavy volume, here under the open sky doesn&rsquo;t  measure up, just doesn&rsquo;t compute against the acoustics of the infinite.</p>
            <p>Encased in this  feeble bubble of sound, I&rsquo;m frankly ashamed of myself, and when the player  malfunctions and the cassette tape unspools, giving a mess of brown coils into  my palm, I&rsquo;m relieved to have to bury the machine at the bottom of my backpack.</p>
            <p>Two hours into  my search, a quarter of a mile from the sea, I literally stumble on the lost  survey monument that will mark the southeast boundary of my homestead. The  so-called monument is a metal pipe surmounted by a round tablet or aluminum cap  bearing various inscriptions. Kneeling, I disentangle it from the dead ferns  and grass, reerect it in its original hole, and hammer it down with a rock. <em>State of Alaska&hellip;Division of Technical Services&hellip;</em></p>
            <p>I rub the cap  with my sleeve and try to read the legend engraved on it. The Rosetta Stone  wasn&rsquo;t translated in a day. What confronts me is a monumental gibberish of  letters, numbers and ciphers. The cap tells me nothing. It&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s cap. All  the same, the fool takes a rubbing to prove that he&rsquo;s been here, and the  rasping of the pencil on the paper reminds me of making tombstone rubbings with  Brenda back in Boston&rsquo;s  colonial burying grounds.</p>
            <p>Later I come to  a solitary, splendidly branching spruce tree. There&rsquo;s a yellow metal plate,  small and square, attached to the tree&rsquo;s trunk by a rusty nail, and the numbers  on it, discernable after I have cleared the deadfall of branches, alert me that  I have reached the southwest boundary of these acres and that if I search  eighteen paces behind me I will be rewarded with the discovery of the next  survey monument, which I indeed find, partly buried in the moss.</p>
            <p>Grateful to  this communicative tree&mdash;it belongs to the priesthood of trees sometimes  referred to as Wisdom Trees, on account of the knowledge they impart&mdash;I shake my  pack off and eat a meal of bread and cheese under it. My hands and arms are  scratched and bloody; I got into trouble in a ravine choked with alders and  salmonberries, and in fact it has never in my life taken me so long to traverse  seven hundred feet. Done eating, I consider the tree branches above me. I  remember making love to Brenda in Mt.   Auburn Cemetery  on a day in March when we were seniors, getting Warburton&rsquo;s muffins and a  bottle of cheap zinfandel and strolling among the graves in our thrift-shop  overcoats, talking easily and kissing long deep kisses until we had found a  perfect tree to rest under. Everything was sufficient back then.</p>
            <p>The water  running in the creek sounds like feathers brushing my closed eyelids. I recline  in the moss. Homesteading remained a fairly theoretical idea until just a few  days ago when I told Brenda over dinner that I was leaving for Kodiak. When you  have been married for a long time, you feel like a heel or conspirator to be  acting on your own, and I hadn&rsquo;t hidden from her that I had submitted paperwork  to the state, but over the summer we had hardly talked about homesteading in a  way that suggested it was more than the usual Alaska pipe dream.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;How long will  you be gone?&rdquo; she said.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No more than  three days.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Three days  this time. What about next time?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You were going  to homestead on the road system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Look, we can&rsquo;t  get the go-ahead permit unless I stake the land. It&rsquo;d be a shame to throw the  chance away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>My siesta done,  I get up and study the country. The land makes a broad shelf here after having  ascended from the beach and before it rises again steeply to become the  1200-foot mountain on the south. From the Wisdom Tree I tramp north a hundred  feet or so, to a sunny elevation flanked by spruce trees, a fireweed meadow  that overlooks the descent to the sea, and from here, visoring my eyes, I gaze  across the blue waters of Wildwood Strait to Salmonberry Island on the other  side. My heart beats louder. Uncanny feeling. It&rsquo;s as though I were dowsing for  a spring and homing in on the prize, only here it&rsquo;s my destiny I seek. I look  back at my pack under the Wisdom Tree, my hat perched on it and my shotgun  leaning against it. I look seaward again. Below, in the tallest clifftop spruce  tree, there&rsquo;s the telltale white oval of a bald eagle perching. Yes, this is  the place. I&rsquo;m sure of it. I&rsquo;ll build Wildwood here. It&rsquo;s right here underfoot.</p>
            <p>* * *</p>
            <p>The light  softens and the air has cooled. Descending through the dense, humid alder  thickets, through a quarter of a mile of jungle, I stop now and then to hang a  strip of red flagging or to hack with my machete. At length I break into the  open grassland above the bluffs, and by nightfall I have found all five of the  survey monuments&mdash;just.</p>
            <p>How badly do I  want these twenty acres? I stow the last pencil rubbing into my backpack and  sit on the cliff&rsquo;s edge feeling elated and very tired. A vast potential is out  there, a freedom I cannot see but only feel as an inward expansion. Is it  because I haven&rsquo;t made it anywhere else in life that I am here? Maybe this is  what I was being saved for. But am I seeing things clearly? The impossibility  of arrival is the mark of a doomed voyage. Have I gone mad?</p>
            <p>My greed for  meaning is as unbecoming as any greed for gold. But still, the questions are  vital to me. Thinking of Brenda and the children, I foresee a difficult winter  in Fairbanks.  How do you make the case that actions taken out of self-respect are distinct  from selfish actions&mdash;how, I mean, if you aren&rsquo;t sure of it yourself?</p>
            <p>The wind whips  the dry grass and the tide sweeps in over the rocks. There&rsquo;s an hour left of  usable twilight. I check the shotgun&mdash;the safety, chamber, magazine&mdash;and then I  hike eastward along a broad bear trail that unwinds beneath the spruce trees.</p>
            <p>When it&rsquo;s dark,  I unroll my sleeping bag in a hollow on the cliffs. The tide slops below among  the rocks. It&rsquo;s funny to think of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett and their ilk  grousing about modern life and striking out for Kentuck and Caroliny to find  freedom and elbow room. You could be crammed into Japan  or Jakarta  nowadays and maybe not mind it if you&rsquo;re accustomed to it. But more than custom  determines us. To yearn for a space the world hasn&rsquo;t squatted on yet and built  its gimcrack structures on, to dream of a pure, simple life lived in the bosom  of creation, a life that never stops being passionate and holy&mdash;that&rsquo;s something  anyone can understand.</p>
            <p>The Big Dipper  spreads before me in the northern sky. The night is huge and inspiring. I roll  onto my belly and by the light of my flashlight I sketch a map of Wildwood,  from the ocean precipices to the Wisdom Tree to the soft high meadow where I  vow to raise a house at the foot of the mountain, from the brooding spruce  trees to the cottonwood glen at the heart of the homestead to the V of the  creeks that merge below in a torrent and, cascading over the bluffs, spew white  and foaming onto the beach.</p>
            <p>Wildwood! Wild  cliffs, wild nights, wild dreams!</p>
            <p>What clerk in  the back office of the Lands Division will open the manila envelope next week  and stamp <em>Received</em> on this map and  add it to my file? Will the clerk even look at the map, or only at the wall  clock? I know how many brothers and sisters are out there, their hearts broken  or languishing, kindred souls out of synch with the world, imagining new  beginnings and new lives.</p>
            <p>The spruce  trees fold their branches above me. The ocean laps below against the cliffs.  For a long while in the darkness the faces of Brenda and the children vacillate  over the starlit map.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Mr.  Everblue</p>
            <p>He was gone six  days instead of the three he had promised. Not that I blame him for &ldquo;forty-knot  winds and heavy seas,&rdquo; as he puts it, but with a five-year-old and a  one-year-old in the house, it doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier, and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a  sign of things to come. One of the schools phoned to offer him a week&rsquo;s work  and I had to tell them he had lit out for the bush. Where is it all going?</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Why is it  called the Wisdom Tree?&rdquo; Ashley asks him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a  very wise tree, and tells you where you are if you&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; he says.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You mean it  talks?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;In a manner of  speaking.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Ashley,  delighted, turns up the palms of her hands, saying to Nicholas, &ldquo;In a manner of  speaking,&rdquo; and Nicholas laughs and beats his spatula on the tray of his high  chair.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;So I lay under  the Wisdom Tree,&rdquo; Jason says, &ldquo;and I saw something six feet up, moving in the  wind.&rdquo; He climbs on a chair and shakes a clump of red-gold fur over us, a witch  doctor wielding his charm. &ldquo;What was it? What giant rubbed his back on the  tree?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bear,&rdquo;  Ashley cries, &ldquo;a brown bear!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;  And the lock of fur falls to the tabletop.</p>
            <p>So Jason is  home. In my arms, he sighs deeply, his mane of hair flung back, his lips  shining as he takes his time over me.</p>
            <p>The weeks go by  and things seem normal enough until the night I come home and find a letter  nailed to the slab door of the house.</p>
            <p><em>Dear Mr. Everblue: I am pleased to enclose your  homestead entry permit... approved&hellip;requirements for proving up on the land and  obtaining patent&hellip;effective date, deadlines, notarized signatures&hellip;subject to  automatic expiration if you fail to comply&hellip;</em></p>
            <p>I tear the  paper off the nail and stand under the porch light hearing the boisterous  voices of the children inside, my thoughts revolving around an outraged center.  Hammering the letter to the door as if to give notice to the world! It&rsquo;s a  gesture of joyful pride, of exuberance, I see that, but there&rsquo;s something  defiant, too, arrogant, as if he&rsquo;s preempting objections by serving me before  I&rsquo;ve even entered the house, a kind of <em>Look,  the terms of our life hereby change</em> or <em>See,  I have marching orders</em> or <em>Ciao,  darling, I&rsquo;m assigned a new parish.</em></p>
            <p>&ldquo;Did you ever  want something so bad that God seemed to come down and make it real for you?&rdquo;  Jason takes me by the shoulders, lowering his face to mine, his eyes shining  blue and feverish. I haven&rsquo;t seen him this intense since last spring when he  first raised the subject of homesteading. His excitement was so contagious back  then, I jumped up and down thinking what a lark it would be. Homesteading!</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If you can  muster every ounce of conviction about something, Brenda, if you can say it  with all your heart&mdash;<em>I want that</em>&mdash;and  truly mean it&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t God love you for it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I suppose,  Jason, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Suppose?&rdquo; He  wants my conviction. He&rsquo;s a strong, limber man, Jason, with a brooding,  emotional temper, and even his bouts of worldliness have something unreal about  them. &ldquo;It never won anybody the lottery, Jason. I can&rsquo;t answer for God, only  for me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>His eyes  flashing, he returns to the cutting board, scoops the vegetables into his hands  and drops them in the saucepan. The hot oil splashes his wrists. Red pepper  juice stains his fingers. &ldquo;Did you read it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s  nothing unclear about the entry permit. It&rsquo;s specific&mdash;specific to the deadline  five years from now by which he has to have proved up on the land. &ldquo;But what  are your plans? How can we make it work?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The sizzle of  the saucepan brings the children, the smells of hot soy sauce and sesame oil  and garlic. Ashley and Nicholas plow into us, crying out to be included, and we  aren&rsquo;t able to talk further until they&rsquo;re in bed.</p>
            <p>Jason mixes us  Black Russians and lays out the homesteading rules:</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to  build a house. I&rsquo;m supposed to live on the place for twenty-five months. I  figure I&rsquo;ll spend the summers there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The numbers  don&rsquo;t add up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;True. I&rsquo;ll  have to put in a full year at some point. Eat the clock up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s  making you do this, Jason. You make it sound as though you had to.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something  I have to do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We have a life  here. Are you bored with it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I want to see  things differently.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What about  seeing things as their father? I left the cities because of you, Jason. We live  on five acres in the middle of Alaska.  How wild do you need to get?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I have to dig  down.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You again.  That&rsquo;s all I hear: you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad  word.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking  about leaving us for two and a half years.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  months. It&rsquo;s a legacy for the children.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It might be  worth more if you got a regular job.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;And you could  have gone into plastic surgery instead of public medicine. You could have  hooked up with a rich kid, Harvard girl.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Bastard! I  followed you here. Are you leaving me? Is that what this is about?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I want to  know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not  that.&rdquo; His voice breaking, Jason lowers his eyes. &ldquo;I have never stopped loving  you, Brenda. I guess after everything I just never picked myself up again. I  have to go back, or in, or through, or something. Before I go on. I have to cut  through all the garbage. It just piles up and up until you forget there was  ever anyone down there. To somehow start from scratch. If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Say.  Anymore.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;All right then  to hell with it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;There is no  such thing as scratch, don&rsquo;t you get it! We have two children. It&rsquo;s too late  for scratch.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What to Wear  and Who to Be</p>
            <p>Months of snowy  cold have settled on interior Alaska.  Four days a week Brenda sees patients at the public medical clinic on Airport Road. Once  a week she moonlights at the office of a senior colleague, a family doctor like  herself. Meanwhile I phone around to the middle schools and high schools to see  which teachers are on radiation therapy or pregnancy leave and need me to cover  for them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me if it&rsquo;s chemistry or creative writing: I&rsquo;ll  substitute for as many days as possible this winter in order to put some money  by for the summer.</p>
            <p>Schools are  like salmon canneries&mdash;factories where the latest catch is purged of undesirable  parts, rinsed, processed, and passed on to their fates. The main difference is  you don&rsquo;t see the teachers and administrators pulling on their rubber gloves  every morning. Nevertheless, when I get a dispatch, I slip into a jacket, with  or without a tie, I put the truck in four-wheel drive, and, though there isn&rsquo;t  much self-respect in it, I go. A substitute teacher is always a sub, a  pretender, a person filling a role more obviously temporary than the rest.</p>
            <p>One day,  looking in my closet at the empty shirts and trousers hanging there, my  impression is the strange, slightly embarrassing one of bumping into somebody I  don&rsquo;t really care to know anymore. I rub the cloth between my fingers. This one  is rough and that one is smooth. This one, women notice me in; in that one I&rsquo;m  nobody. Even in Fairbanks,  where the clothes define the man less than anywhere else I have lived, even  here it&rsquo;s all about donning the jacket. Here are my firefighting duds, waiting  on a hanger, the green trousers and the yellow top, ready to get between me and  the world, to protect me from the flames I am paid every summer to fight. Put  on the firefighting duds, I can be suddenly flame retardant, and it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s  guess if I&rsquo;m a hero or a fool. Or pull on the mohair jacket, or, if I&rsquo;m feeling  fine, the silk one, and, magically respectable, I&rsquo;ll deliver a lecture, command  a teen to be seated, and in general make myself more disliked than if I had  stayed in denim.</p>
            <p>I am heartily  sick of it. These limp garments are like the different philosophies I&rsquo;ve  grasped at through my life, the fashionable attitudes I&rsquo;ve tried on, hoping to  be found not wanting by good society, or, if my interest was in bad society,  the unfashionable attitudes, all the hand-me-down ideas that were really too  big or too small but made me feel bright for a day or two, the wrung-out rags  of history that covered me but left me shivering.</p>
            <p>* * *</p>
            <p>Winter drifts  on. Like the oil in the pipes, like the sap in the trees, our blood gels, mine  and Brenda&rsquo;s. Our arguments reduce everything to a concrete and troublesome  plane. I don&rsquo;t know what fulfillment my life is meant for, but I believe my  destiny is at stake, and frankly I despise the drip-drop verbiage that  adulterates a great enterprise. Bickering with a woman is love&rsquo;s peck on the  cheek, and I hate it. When I shut my eyes a radiant Wildwood Wildwood  pulses like a living heart.</p>
            <p>Our house  encloses warmth, light, and the loud, happy cries of the children. Every log in  the wall conveys the brawny goodness of the earth. This is Ashley&rsquo;s home, far  from the Los Angeles  of my childhood, the arid land of riots, oil embargos and war news. Nicholas  toddles after her, rustling the world by its lowest branches. I am dizzied,  literally, with a swirl of blood to the heart, to watch the children in their  sweetness and trust, their ignorance of the raw stuff they&rsquo;ve emerged from,  their innocence of the upheavals they bring into the house. Ashley is secretly  enraptured with my Wildwood adventure. I see she will become my greatest ally.</p>
            <p>The map of Kodiak Island spreads before me, a window in the  windowless wall of winter. In bleak moments my vision of a house at the foot of  the mountain over the sea seems impossibly distant. I pore over the statutory  regulations governing Alaska&rsquo;s  homestead law. But my resolve falters. Does Brenda expect me to ask for  forgiveness? You would think I had confessed to an infidelity. Well! If a man  is restless and dissatisfied with the world, the course should be to try out  another and see how much of the problem is himself.</p>
            <p>Many years ago  I had a dream. It was brief, vivid, and very private. It happened during the  springtime of our love. Strange that in the middle of my highest happiness I  had a dream that spoke to me of a realm beyond happiness.</p>
            <p>We lie on a  blanket on a gently sloping expanse of green grass. Brenda sleeps. Her legs are  tan and bare to the thighs. A shadow flickers across her, and looking up I see  an eagle turn in the sky. The great bird wheels above us, and I have a sense  that the bird is aware of me&mdash;has, in a sense, come for me. The eagle flies on  beyond the tops of the evergreen trees, and I&rsquo;m drawn to my feet, watching it  go. Brenda sleeps on. I look at the sky again, gazing after the eagle, and I  start across the grass with long strides toward the trees.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong Opinions</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Why not?  Doctors are always going off to Congo  and stuff. Or is that only French doctors?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a  physician, Jason. I don&rsquo;t get summers off.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Is it in the  Oath?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t  offered to take the kids with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d say no.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t  fight very hard.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You want to  fight?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I want you to  acknowledge in a meaningful way that your actions have an effect on me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;A <em>meaningful</em> way no less.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Broken cabins,  the ghosts of abandoned dreams, litter this land called Alaska. The homesteading failure rate is  something like ninety per cent. Yet he wants to uproot our lives for it. &ldquo;What  makes you think you&rsquo;re different?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> different.&rdquo; He hits the table with  his fist, glaring at me out of bright, uneasy eyes. I flinch in my chair,  knowing I&rsquo;ve misspoken. Have I taken him for granted? Did I let him languish  during some fateful moment of private pain when this bitter resolve formed in  him?</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Yes, you are  different, Jason. I don&rsquo;t doubt you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Next thing I  know, I&rsquo;m sitting in his lap and he&rsquo;s biting my throat, working his hand under  my camisole. Our hearts beat together. &ldquo;Would you like the full English  breakfast today, madame?&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m laughing and holding him close, his temple  pounding at my breast.</p>
            <p>We restrain  ourselves, smiling at the children. They&rsquo;ve set up a puppet stage on which  Ashley is performing a fable for Nicholas.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I was  thinking, Jason. You have a purchase option on the land.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Theoretically,  yes&mdash;if we fail to prove up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t  fail, I know you won&rsquo;t. But still&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be  the same.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Hear me out.  What&rsquo;s the appraisal?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Thirty-two  grand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What if we  could afford it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I want to take  it back from the state.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d own  it either way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I could buy a  whore or a kidney, too. It&rsquo;s not the same. Think, Brenda. We don&rsquo;t have feudal  lords anymore, just the state. We turn the soil over, we claim it for  ourselves&mdash;it&rsquo;s a revolutionary thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;God, can&rsquo;t you  stop living your life like a damn book!&rdquo; I abruptly get off his lap. &ldquo;Why do  you have to see it that way? I&rsquo;m thinking about us and the children and the  effect on all of us, Jason. Listen to me,&rdquo; sitting in my chair and rattling the  newspaper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen ads, lots of ads. Land at Haystack Mountain,  land at Salcha. Acres and acres of it. Why don&rsquo;t we buy a piece that&rsquo;s close to  home&mdash;on the road system&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Fuck the road  system! I don&rsquo;t need the road system!&rdquo; Roaring the words, Jason rises from his  chair, dark-faced and clenching his fists. Whatever fabulous thing was playing  on the puppet stage is done. The children, the fox, the duck, the dragon, the  bull&mdash;they all peer over at us. My hiss trails off in the silence.</p>
            <p>Jason&rsquo;s neck  swells and relaxes. &ldquo;Go on, my friends. The show must go on. Mom and dad are  merely disputing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll buy land  close to home. We&rsquo;ll build when we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;And when is  that, Brenda? Never. The deadline is now. Look around you. Be honest what you  see. Everybody&rsquo;s glum about their lot. If life is such a sorry affair, why not  change it? They bitch and snicker about everything under the sun. They live to  cheat the system of a buck and justify it by blaming their neighbor. They  withhold their love and their vote, but on Monday morning they&rsquo;ll bow down all  the same. Open their mouths to snarl and close with a bit between their teeth.  Tequila on Saturday, a bloody mary Sunday morning. Screw it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the  easiest thing in the world to tell other people to throw caution to the wind,  Jason.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  telling anybody anything. To hell with changing anyone. I don&rsquo;t give people enough  credit. I used to think, These people must be joking. Do they really believe it  matters what brand of purse they carry or shoe they wear? And do you know what  I&rsquo;ve decided? They do. Yes, they do. And most will go to their graves thinking  the same. Haha! And I don&rsquo;t give a damn. Not the smallest part of a damn. To  each his own. I make no apologies.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>* * *</p>
            <p>When I read of  a wealthy socialite who has renounced her fortune and entered a convent, an  artist who has wandered off into oblivion, or a New Yorker or Chicagoan who has  turned wrangler and moved to Wyoming, I wonder: How sincere are they really?  How long will their resolution last? How does their story end? Does the  socialite say her millionth ave? The artist create an unknown masterpiece? The  New Yorker surrender to the slow charm of the provinces?</p>
            <p>I should have  known when I asked him <em>What makes you  think you&rsquo;re different?</em> I was asking him a question he was only too happy  and well qualified to answer. This is more than a bout of frontier romanticism.  Look how many years he&rsquo;s held on to the old <em>Mother  Earth News </em>with the wild bear on the cover and the magical banner Free Land in Alaska. While the Harvard boys  stampeded to Broad &amp; Wall or Hollywood &amp; Vine, Jason just wanted to get  past Whitehorse  before winter. God, I&rsquo;m a fool. He would give up our bed for this. He&rsquo;s in his  study, warming his hands over the campfires of will and destiny, his maps  spread before him&mdash;topographic, aerial, nautical, geological&mdash;reflecting the  intricacies of his brain while pointing him toward some region beyond it.  Explorer, conqueror, general, freethinker, anyone who was ever at odds with the  world, who dreamed of a terra incognita of his own, every man who wouldn&rsquo;t  sacrifice his private dignity for a public peace, every woman who wouldn&rsquo;t  barter her self-respect for a reputation, every malcontent, outcast and rebel  soul willing to forsake society for the idea of a freer or grander one,  renounce its protections in exchange for the wonders and terrors of a  wilderness&mdash;just so long as he is king&mdash;just so long as he answers to no one!</p>
            <p>In April Jason  shows up at the medical clinic and enters my office without an appointment.  Bile-colored corduroy jacket, red eyes, his hair blown out to the sides: &ldquo;You  look terrible,&rdquo; I tell him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Can I have a  prescription?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Giardia.  Beaver fever as we laymen call it. No offense.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Let me  explain.&rdquo; Jason sits in the nearest chair and crosses his legs, playing the  patient. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving for Kodiak Island soon.  Getting supplies together. I drink the creek water, and it&rsquo;s good water, but  I&rsquo;d like to have a remedy in case of emergency.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  normally prescribe a drug before it&rsquo;s needed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Understood.  You see, it&rsquo;s very isolated. No roads. No medical help.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>I write him an  Rx for metronidazole. &ldquo;Kodiak Island. It  sounds like an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Baby, you said  it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;When do you  leave?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;May Day, give  or take.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I envy you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he  leans forward, watching me pace the office, &ldquo;are you married?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  anymore.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t  envy me, join me. There&rsquo;s a berth open.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave  this, Jason.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You need to  ask?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I estimate  fifteen hundred dollars in gear and expenses for the summer.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave  the kids with me of course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my  hands full with the chainsaw.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;My hands  aren&rsquo;t full?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;All right,  I&rsquo;ll take the kids.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of  your mind.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Jason tucks the  prescription into his pocket, getting to his feet. &ldquo;Come with me, Brenda.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no  income.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Suspend your  notions of necessity for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I fix bodies  all day&mdash;we throw out the broken ones.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;All the more  reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Jason, we&rsquo;re  not hearing each other.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Before you  bring up marriage counseling, let me say I hear you beautifully. The voice of  convention never had a lovelier mouthpiece. What if everyone behaved like you,  Jason? Oh, horrors! They never will, baby. There&rsquo;s not a thing on earth to  worry about. Come with me, dammit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t  understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Understanding  has nothing to do with it. Curse your understanding. Say yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Oh, Jason, I  don&rsquo;t know, I wish&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;<em>Kodiak Island</em><em>.</em>&rdquo; He steps nearer. &ldquo;Listen to the sound  of it. The waves crashing on the rocky capes. The smell of the sea. I had  choices, Brenda. Craig Lake, Crazy   Mountain, Talkeetna. I  struck them off, one by one. Listen! Do you hear it? The giants roaring. The  flowers unfolding. You can smell the sap of time dripping. Put your little tap  in the tree of life and taste its honey. Or you can stay here and rot.&rdquo; He  seizes me by the wrists and pulls me against him. &ldquo;Say yes, Brenda, I beg you.&rdquo;  He&rsquo;s holding me, pressing me close, crushing me to his chest. &ldquo;Say yes or say  goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
