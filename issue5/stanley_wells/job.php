            <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most frequently debated questions relating  to Shakespeare is the matter of whether his sonnets are directly based on his  own experience, or whether they are, as is often suggested, &lsquo;literary  exercises&rsquo;, fictitious projections of imagined experiences. It is a question to  which there could, perhaps, be more than one answer. As Paul   Edmondson and I write in our book on the Sonnets, we believe  it to be fallacious to read the 154 poems as a unified collection.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> We suggest for instance that not all of the first 126 poems are necessarily  addressed to a male, as is still frequently stated, and that those that are so  addressed are not necessarily all addressed to the same male. Similarly it is  possible that some of the poems are more or less genuinely personal outpourings  while others are more fictional imaginings. As a dramatist, Shakespeare spent  most of his life imagining himself into the lives and imaginations of  fictitious persons. The Sonnets might be as it were dramatic monologues with no  basis in real life. Some of them could be straightforward exercises in lyric  form. I have come to believe, nevertheless, that some, indeed many of them,  reflect circumstances of the author&rsquo;s own emotional and sexual life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are  several reasons for this. One is that, while it is impossible to date the poems  with any precision, there are good reasons for believing that many of them were  written during the 1590s, when the sonnet was a fashionable form, so their  late, and possibly unauthorized publication in 1609, long after this fashion  had died down, suggests at least that they were not written as professional  exercises, to make money and to enhance the poet&rsquo;s reputation, as the narrative  poems, <em>Venus and Adonis</em> (1593) and <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em> (1594), clearly  were. Another, far more subjective reason is that to me the exploration of,  especially, emotional situations of extreme anguish in some of the poems has  the ring of authenticity. I should not be able to defend this position on  purely intellectual grounds, since the man who could portray the emotional and  sexual anguish of characters such as Troilus and Othello could have written no  less convincingly of such passions in non-dramatic poems. But I could point to  the fact that in the only poems in which the protagonist has a name, it is  Shakespeare&rsquo;s own name &ndash; Will. This distinguishes the collection from all  others of the period, in which an addressee has a personal name, usually of a  romantic cast such as Fidessa, Delia, Stella, and so on. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason  for believing that some of the poems spring from personal experience is that  they clearly adumbrate a triangular love relationship between the poet, a male  friend also named Will, and an unnamed woman who is sexually involved with both  of them. They do this in a manner that, regarded as an attempt at the figuring  forth for uninformed readers of a coherent narrative, is utterly incompetent,  while being more intelligible as a projection of events that have for the poet  a reality which he does not need or wish to spell out for readers, or indeed  which he actively wishes to conceal from them. This makes many of the poems  rather like telephone conversations in which we are allowed to hear only one of  the speakers, and it contributes greatly to their enigmatic quality. It  differentiates them from anguished speeches in the plays, by characters such as  Leontes in <em>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</em>, and  Posthumus in <em>Cymbeline</em>, in that there  the suffering is explained by its context. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may  also be worth pointing out that of all the sonnet collections of the period,  Shakespeare&rsquo;s is the most original, the one least clearly indebted to the  continental tradition of Petrarchism. Indeed the poem with the closest links  with this tradition parodies it: &lsquo;<em>My</em> mistress&rsquo; eyes,&rsquo; writes Shakespeare,  &lsquo;are nothing like the sun.&rsquo; (Sonnet 130) And he declares that the reality of  his love transcends convention. And another aspect of their originality is the  extreme explicitness about sex displayed in some of them, including one of the  &lsquo;will&rsquo; poems that I shall quote later. There is nothing remotely like this in  any sonnet collection of the period. The ones that come closest are Richard  Barnfield&rsquo;s but they are far more playful in tone. Yet recently Barbara  Everett, in a lengthy and characteristically subtle essay published in the <em>London Review of Books</em> and called  &lsquo;Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Sonnet&rsquo;, succeeded in writing about the poems  without once mentioning sex.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if we  think of the collection as including poems of autobiographical content, what do  they tell us? One, they show that Shakespeare &nbsp;was unfaithful to his wife, and probably  frequently so. Furthermore we need to consider the triangular relationship  involving friend and mistress adumbrated in both the poems printed earlier in  the collection, up to No. 126, which include all those clearly addressed to a  male, and in those printed later, from No. 127 onwards, which include the &lsquo;dark  lady&rsquo; sonnets. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has  been justly remarked that, uniquely among Elizabethan sonnet collections &lsquo;for  the first time in the entire history of the sonnet, the desired object [the  writer assumes a single object] is flawed.&rsquo;<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; Sonnet 35 alludes to an unnamed &lsquo;trespass&rsquo;, a  &lsquo;sensual fault&rsquo; which the poet forgives. No. 41 opens a mini-sequence with what  starts as a mild enough admission that it is understandable that the friend&rsquo;s  youth and beauty should cause a woman to woo him:</p>
            <blockquote>And when a woman woos, what woman&rsquo;s son<br>
              Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?</blockquote>
But in the sestet the poet more bitterly  expresses dismay that the woman with whom the friend is linked is the poet&rsquo;s  own mistress:&nbsp;
  <blockquote>Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,<br>
              And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth<br>
              Who lead thee in their riot even there<br>
              Where thou art forced to break a two-fold troth:<br>
              Hers, by the beauty  tempting her to thee,<br>
    Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.</blockquote>
  
              Then the next poem says that, though the poet dearly  loved the woman, &lsquo;That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, / A loss in love  that toucheth me more dearly.&rsquo; Other poems, too, such as Sonnets 93, 95-6, and  120&nbsp; show a troubled sense of a friend&rsquo;s transgressions.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same  theme emerges in the &lsquo;dark lady&rsquo; poems. Sonnet 133 &lsquo;curses &lsquo;that heart that  makes my heart to groan / For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.&rsquo;  Nothing is left. The woman has both betrayed the poet and enslaved his  &lsquo;sweet&rsquo;st friend&rsquo;, his &lsquo;next self&rsquo;, so that &lsquo;Of him, myself, and thee I am  forsaken.&rsquo; Sonnet 134 runs straight on to beg the &lsquo;covetous&rsquo; woman to restore  his &lsquo;kind&rsquo; friend to him. But there is no hope: &lsquo;Him have I lost; thou hast  both him and me; / He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.&rsquo; Then in Sonnet  135 he puns tortuously and despairingly on the many possible senses of the word  &lsquo;will&rsquo; &ndash; the word occurs 13 times -, senses which include the name of both the  poet and another man, desire, penis, and vagina, At what points to capitalize  the word as a proper name here is very much a decision for the editor to puzzle  over:
              <blockquote>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,<br>
              And Will to boot, and Will in overplus.<br>
              More than enough am I that vex thee still, <br>
              To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br>
              Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<br>
              Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br>
              Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br>
              And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br>
              The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br>
              And in abundance addeth to his store;<br>
              So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will<br>
              One will of mine to make thy large Will more.<br>
  Let no unkind no fair beseechers  kill;<br>
   Think all but one, and me in that  one Will.</blockquote>
            The following poem continues the word play, with seven  uses of the word &lsquo;will&rsquo;, concluding categorically with &lsquo;my name is Will.&rsquo;<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it  difficult not to read these poems as expressions of resentment at sexual  infidelity on the part of both a friend and a woman with whom he is linked. To  me, the intensity of the poet&rsquo;s involvement with both one or more males and at  least one woman suggests that he had both homosexual and heterosexual extra-marital  relationships. But there is everything to suggest that if he did so he was  conscious of betraying ideals, of behaving out of unreasonable human frailty in  ways that part of him deplored: his eyes &lsquo;know what beauty is, see where it  lies, / Yet what the best is take the worst to be&rsquo; (137); &lsquo;she that makes me  sin / Awards me pain&rsquo; (141); &lsquo;Love is my sin&rsquo; and his mistress&rsquo;s lips &lsquo;have  sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, / Robbed others&rsquo; beds&rsquo; revenues of  their rents&rsquo; (142); &lsquo;Past cure I am, now reason is past care, / And frantic mad  with evermore unrest&rsquo; (147); &lsquo;In loving thee thou know&rsquo;st I am forsworn&nbsp; .  . . But why of two oaths&rsquo; breach do I accuse thee / When I break twenty?&rsquo; (152)  He is, he acknowledges, the victim of lust which overwhelms reason: 
              <blockquote>The&rsquo;expense of  spirit in a waste of shame <br>
              Is lust in  action; and till action, lust <br>
              Is perjured,  murderous, bloody, full of blame, <br>
              Savage,  extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, <br>
              Enjoyed no  sooner but despis&egrave;d straight, <br>
              Past reason  hunted, and no sooner had <br>
              Past reason  hated as a swallowed bait <br>
              On purpose  laid to make the taker mad; <br>
              Mad in pursuit  and in possession so, <br>
              Had, having,  and in quest to have, extreme; <br>
              A bliss in  proof and proved, a very woe; <br>
              Before, a joy  proposed; behind, a dream. <br>
  All this the world well knows, yet none knows well <br>
 To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. (129) </blockquote>
              This is surely  a man with a conscience, betrayed by his sexuality.</p>
