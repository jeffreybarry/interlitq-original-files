			  <br>One of the things that’s long intrigued me about India is its curious, grudging relationship to money – by which I mean not markets, capital, financial gain or material success, but, specifically, the individual bank note and small change. I was reminded of this when, a few days ago, taking out a new five-hundred rupee note to pay a bill at a nursing home, I was made to notice the razor-thin tear in the crisp paper, and given it back. ‘I just got this from an ATM,’ I said, shaking my head; the receptionist, noticing my look of exasperation, and mistaking it for pique at the cash machine, commiserated by sharing his own experiences with me: ‘These days even banks aren’t reliable. They …’ and continued with words I couldn’t hear properly.

            <p>I gave him a  comparably crisp note, a flawless one this time; and suppressed the urgent  question I often feel like asking and sometimes have: Why will a note with  blemishes not do? People&rsquo;s responses are varied: some grin, as if, like a  child, I&rsquo;ve gone straight to the heart of the matter without any understanding  of what it is that makes our lives what they are: complex and sometimes opaque.  Others, with downcast eyes, pretend not to hear; they are helpless &ndash; silent  adherents to a law that only a fool or a saint or a foreigner would have no  inkling of.</p>
<p> What was the next sensible step,  though? Would I have to go to a bank, in the near-forty-degree-Celsius brunt of  the morning, and return this note for another one? Instead, I had a cappuccino  at one of those coffee shop chains, where the note changed hands without  comment or scrutiny or judgement. Maybe the thin, placatory young man (little  more than a teenager) hadn&rsquo;t seen the tear, which was almost invisible unless  you shook the note. On the other hand, he&rsquo;d noticed it, but both he and the  chain he worked for and for that matter the coffee he served represented a new  order, to which the physical state of the bank note had suddenly become  irrelevant. This development had occurred belatedly, unevenly, but it&rsquo;s  possible to hazard a guess and say it <em>has</em> occurred, at least in some enclaves of the rapidly changing metropolis we now  inhabit. The only other party in Calcutta that will accept a damaged-looking  note occupies an axis opposite to the one the coffee chain represents: I mean the  much-resented parking attendant. This ghost of the license raj, darkened and  attenuated by exposure to the elements, but impelled by a sudden breathless  energy that can make him cover half the length of a street in seconds, knows  the money he collects from the car isn&rsquo;t seen as a legitimate fee at all, but  as gratuitous commission. Though he&rsquo;s seldom tested &ndash; because the imprimatur of  the state clings to him like a faint film &ndash; he&rsquo;s aware he has little authority.  He will accept any kind of note at all, new or aged or tattered. He represents  the rarely but oddly accommodating nature of the old order; of how it&rsquo;s based  on a mixture of complicity, mistrust, and mutual understanding &ndash; a DNA of  co-operation that&rsquo;s changing, but hasn&rsquo;t gone away.</p>
<p>The realisation that the physical  condition of a bank note is unimportant came to me in my years in England &ndash; not  in a flash of light, but over time, semi-conscious, semi-attentive, as ragged  five- or ten-pound notes, a few even rescued by a simple and firm band of Sellotape,  changed hands without a word. At some point, nations made the transition from  coins &ndash; which, in their weight, their detailed, minted appearance, the  longevity for which they&rsquo;d been designed, seemed to contain the value they  represented &ndash; to notes, which no one could confuse for having any value at all.  There lay the paradox of money as we&rsquo;ve understood it &ndash; why the world abounds  in it, and why so little of it&rsquo;s available. To ascribe value to a piece of  paper is, of course, to be part of a contract, as well as to be involved in a  willing suspension of disbelief. The sheer literal worthlessness of the frayed  note makes its symbolic value transcendental and near-indestructible. In India,  though, this isn&rsquo;t the case. The symbolic worth of the note is almost  overwhelmed by its physical, worldly incarnation, and by the loose but  inescapable aesthetic guidelines that inform our scrutiny. As the torn,  perishable note threatens to fall apart, so does the value it represents; in  this, it almost becomes indistinguishable from the commodities in the market it  was assigned to purchase. Only yesterday, I heard my mother, taking out a  fatigued-looking twenty-rupee note from her purse, complain, &lsquo;Where <em>does</em> he get them from?&rsquo;, referring to  the driver of her car. She was speaking of the note as it were a vegetable or a  fruit the driver had brought back home; it had begun to wither; it lacked  freshness.</p>
<p> This leads me to the other mystery  in our daily lives related to the monetary: the curiously perennial shortage of  change. Give a five-hundred rupee note to a shopkeeper (it used to be a  hundred-rupee one) and he will close ranks, his expression give away nothing  and everything. Then there&rsquo;s the inscrutable, sly, adamant refusal to part with  coins, leading to the swift, across-the-counter, yogic calculations peculiar to  Indians; for instance, if, on being presented with a bill for sixty two rupees,  you were to give the shopkeeper a hundred rupees, he will say, &lsquo;Do you have two  rupees?&rsquo; This is the default query; if you don&rsquo;t have two rupees, it results in  a mixture of accusatory silence and introspection. And who can forget those  pregnant moments in taxis our lives expand to make room for, when the driver,  having been handed a large note, first rummages tiredly in one pocket, then  another, then takes out a carefully folded wad and looks at it in the  half-light? Then the coins appear in one palm; money is broken into smaller and  smaller units because <em>you</em> had no  change; almost a minute passes in the heat, and nothing happens. This is when  you might wonder where all the change goes; what causes this constant paucity;  why we all hoard coins and notes of smaller denominations, and lie about not  possessing change even when we have it in our wallets; that the paucity doesn&rsquo;t  even necessarily have anything to do with the general or literal or metaphorical  lack of wealth in circulation.</p>
<p>The poet C P Surendran once gave me  an insight, in Delhi,  into why the situation as we know it exists. We&rsquo;d arrived in Khan Market late  in the morning; we had to pay the fare; not a single auto driver, though, among  the line of autos parked in the front, could give us change for a hundred  rupees. My old puzzlement came back: &lsquo;How can not <em>one</em> of them have the money?&rsquo; C P said: &lsquo;These people don&rsquo;t bring  the last day&rsquo;s earnings when they return to work. They begin each day afresh.&rsquo; And  this was the first time someone had said something illuminating to me on the  subject, and opened my eyes to the most common sort of employee around us: the  daily wage-earner. This person goes back home at night, possibly having spent  part of his money on <em>beedis</em>, <em>gutka</em>, or drink, possibly giving some of  it to the family, or part to an employer to whom he owes a species of mortgage.  The next day he&rsquo;s back, like a migrant, to whom the business of livelihood is  old and inevitable, but to whom money is always new. He could be anywhere.  Having money doesn&rsquo;t mean owning it; it means to relentlessly make or break the  makeshift rules of exchange. Change isn&rsquo;t hoarded for the purposes of saving or  spending, but because it constantly needs to be earned. Others, in the salaried  middle classes, or in trade or business, have to deal with this person in their  own manner: by outwitting or outwaiting him, or &ndash; what&rsquo;s more common &ndash; by  mimicking him. </p>
