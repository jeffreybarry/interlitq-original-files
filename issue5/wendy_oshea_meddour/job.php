              <p>V. S. Naipaul’s travel book <em>Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Amongst the Converted Peoples</em> (1998), is set in the non-Arab Muslim world and based on five months of travel in Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan and Malaysia. It is the follow up to <em>Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey</em> (1981) and charts a return voyage in which the narrator goes looking ‘for people from the past’ (p. 153). Unsurprisingly, it is impossible to reconcile the conflicting critical responses that Naipaul’s ‘Islamic excursions’ have received. Critics that are left wing, liberal or anti-imperialist in outlook have condemned Naipaul for his neo-imperialist attitudes, attributing them to a range of personality flaws and postcolonial insecurities.  They are particularly disturbed by his politics, accusing him of Islamophobia, racism and, more recently, Hindu fascism.  Rightwing critics (and those who condone American foreign policy in the Middle-East) view Naipaul’s Muslim journeys rather differently. They celebrate his ‘fearless truth-telling’, commend his ‘moral’ insights and praise him for his willingness to tackle ‘cultural irrationalism’.  </p>

            <br><p>To date, both the angry criticism and enthusiastic  praise elicited by Naipaul&rsquo;s travelogues focuses on &ldquo;Naipaul-the man&rdquo;. This is  highly problematic because it assumes that the text is transparent &ndash; an idea  that has been repeatedly undermined by recent developments in literary theory. The  idea that the &ldquo;traveller&rsquo;s &lsquo;I&rsquo; &rdquo; &nbsp;in the  text <em>is</em> &ldquo;the traveller&rdquo; outside of the  text is, of course, encouraged by the travel genre. Travelogues aim to convince  the reader of their truth. But if we are too readily beguiled by the text, then  our conflation of &ldquo;Naipaul &ndash; the man&rdquo; with &ldquo;Naipaul &ndash; the narrator&rdquo; will lead  to the conflation of &ldquo;characters in the text&rdquo; with &ldquo;real subjects&rdquo;. This will  blind us to the complicated effects of both language and narration in the textual  construction of &ldquo;the real&rdquo;. It is important, therefore, to remember that the &ldquo;Naipaul&rdquo;  in <em>Beyond Belief </em>is a literary character  and the &ldquo;Muslim reality&rdquo; presented is constituted in and out of skilfully  crafted, though frequently disturbing, textual strategies. I choose the word &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo;  because, unlike most travel narratives, <em>Beyond  Belief</em> has gothic realism at its core. As the plot unfolds, we follow &ldquo;Naipaul  &ndash; the narrator&rdquo; on his &ldquo;Islamic Excursion&rdquo; through lands inhabited by brainwashed  subjects and haunted by unspeakable horrors. </p>
<p>Although literary  critics overwhelmingly accept that there is an ambivalent relationship between  travel writing and fiction,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> travel writing is still largely referred to as <em>non-fictional</em> literature.  This label is misleading as it detracts from the fact that travel writing is an  established literary genre full of narrative conventions and fictional devices.  Travel writing and fiction frequently overlap and intertwine and one of the  main characteristics of the travel form is to convince the reader of its  transparency: its ability to present us with a reliable account of an  unfamiliar world. Whilst critics continue to celebrate Naipaul for his &ldquo;moral  integrity&rdquo; and &ldquo;commitment to truth&rdquo;, it is not surprising that <em>Beyond Belief</em> continues to be read as if it were a factual  text. Repeatedly, we are promised that Naipaul&rsquo;s travel writing will &ldquo;enable&rdquo;  western readers to gain an &ldquo;insight&rdquo; into the life of Muslims and the text  repeatedly encourages this sort of reading. In the prologue to <em>Beyond Belief</em>,  the narrative voice assures us that &ldquo;THIS is a book about people. It is not a  book of opinions.&rdquo; (Naipaul 1998, 1) Following in the tradition of the travel  narrator, the Naipaul that guides us through our narrative journey promises  that &ldquo;the truth&rdquo; will be presented to us in an undistorted manner. Moreover,  the sophisticated and highly educated narrator at the centre of <em>Beyond Belief </em>is sensitive to the ways  in which obtrusiveness can undermine the authority of a &ldquo;non-fictional&rdquo; text,  and therefore promises that the &ldquo;writer will be less present, less of an  inquirer&rdquo;. Instead, the voice of the Prologue informs us, he will be &ldquo;in the  background, trusting to his instinct&rdquo;(2). Already, the narrator has split into  a least two characters &ndash; the voice of the Prologue and the voice of the main  narrative. Modelling himself on a figure esteemed by nineteenth century English  romantics, the Naipaul of the Prologue claims to be a pure, natural and  instinctive artist. In this manner, he assures us that we can rely on the later  narrator&rsquo;s objectivity. </p>
<p>Victorian literary conventions not only  influence the characterisation of the text&rsquo;s narrator. In this literary period,  the English novel as a genre had not yet found a narrative device that could  provide the illusion that the reader could enter the mind of the character.  Modernist conventions such as the &lsquo;stream of consciousness&rdquo; were yet to emerge.  Consequently, the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; drama was displaced onto an excessively responsive  physical body or environment. Nineteenth century literature twitches with  hysterical characters prone to excessive blushing, hyperventilation, trembling  and faints. For example, in Wilkie Collins&rsquo; novel, <em>The Woman in White</em>, &ldquo;womanish  tears&rdquo;, shivering skin and severe bouts of &ldquo;nervousness&rdquo; besiege the main  characters. All the doubts and concerns that the characters have are played out  on the surface of the skin. Similarly, in a novel such as Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s <em>Jane  Eyre</em>, we know when the central character is angry or frustrated because, at  these moments of crisis, a backdrop of scarlet coloured soft furnishings and  violent rainstorms suddenly appears. This technique of narrative displacement  is repeatedly evident when the narrator encounters Muslims in <em>Beyond Belief</em>. </p>
<p>The symptoms that the narrator exhibits are not the  typical shivers, faints or sweats of the Victorian hero or heroine. Instead,  Naipaul&rsquo;s internal anxiety and, in some cases, clear disgust, manifests itself  in a very specific manner. On encountering practising Muslims, Naipaul begins  to suffer from severe breathing restrictions and experiences an accompanying  change in air quality. The first incident occurs when  our narrator visits Imaduddin&rsquo;s office. Imaduddin lives in Indonesia and  is referred to as an &ldquo;unusual man&rdquo; because he is &ldquo;a man of science&rdquo; and &ldquo;a  dedicated man of the faith&rdquo;. Naipaul is uncomfortable with this &ldquo;contradiction&rdquo;  (despite their long and intertwined history, science and Islam are, in the  narrator&rsquo;s view, incompatible). It is clear that Naipaul also regards Imaduddin  to be a hypocrite: he takes exception to Imaduddin&rsquo;s wealth, preferring &ldquo;his&rdquo;  Muslims to be pious and poor. Despite the kindness that Imaduddin shows his  guest, his &ldquo;Muslimness&rdquo; causes Naipaul to experience unpleasant physical  reactions. Naipaul enters the office and, loyal to nineteenth century realism,  begins to make his inventory of the room:

<blockquote>On one side of  the laptop was a well-handled Koran; on the other side was a pile of shoddily  produced paperback books, perhaps a foot high, of similar size and in electric  blue covers, which had been published in Egypt and might have been a very  long commentary on the Koran: no doubt like meat and drink to Imaduddin. (Naipaul  1988, 16) </blockquote>
            Naipaul  is safe whilst Imaduddin remains in the room, but when Imaduddin answers the  adhan (call to prayer) and deserts Naipaul, the very presence of what Naipaul <em>suspects</em> to be a set of &ldquo;Islamic books&rdquo; (he cannot read Arabic and guesses the books&rsquo;  contents) is enough to provoke serious health implications for our guide. We  are informed that 
            <blockquote>without the man himself [&hellip;] his  missionary paraphernalia felt oppressive [&hellip;]. It was only someone like  Imaduddin who could give point and life to the electric-blue Egyptian  paperbacks on the glass-topped desk. (19-20) </blockquote>
            In  his heightened state of anxiety, Naipaul transforms Imaduddin&rsquo;s private reading  material into &ldquo;dangerous missionary paraphernalia&rdquo; with awesome powers. They  are the &ldquo;meat and drink&rdquo;, the life-blood upon which Imaduddin apparently  survives. The &ldquo;electric-blue&rdquo; covers suggest that these books are made of  hazardous, explosive materials and, being only &lsquo;shoddily-produced&rdquo;, they are  set in stark contrast to the laptop computer and glass-desk upon which they  rest. Naipaul prefers not to ask Imaduddin about the content of these books,  for this would deflate the tension of the passage. Naipaul reassures himself  with the thought that this possible commentary on <em>The Qur&rsquo;an </em>&ldquo;is something that only a man like Imaduddin could give  point and life to&rdquo;. However, mere proximity to these potentially &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; books  causes Naipaul to suffer from the &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; atmosphere that they generate  (19-20). This episode offers a foretaste of what is to come and Naipaul endures  far more severe reactions when he is exposed to the material presence of  Islamic literature in Pakistan. </p>
              <p>The second change in atmospheric quality occurs when  Naipaul visits Mohammed Akram Ranjha at a commune run by, in the narrator&rsquo;s words,  &ldquo;the most important of the fundamentalist groups: Jamaat-i-Islami&rdquo;. Imprisoned  for kidnapping and possibly helping to murder his brother&rsquo;s wife (the narrator&rsquo;s  &nbsp;choice of Muslim &ldquo;interviewees&rdquo; is not,  as he earlier claims, quite &ldquo;representative&rdquo;), Mohammed shares a cell with a &ldquo;political  prisoner&rdquo;. This leads to his &ldquo;jailhouse conversion.&rdquo; Eventually, a lawyer - who  we are told is &ldquo;crazed with religion&rdquo; - helps Mohammed get into Law College.  Whilst practicing law, Mohammed becomes politically active on behalf of  Jamaat-i-Islami. His son, a thirty-four year old senior customs officer called  Saleem, agrees to drive Naipaul to the commune on the edge of Lahore. This is when Naipaul realises that he  has made his first major mistake: he failed to accept Saleem&rsquo;s &ldquo;offer of  air-conditioning&rdquo;. Naipaul refused the offer because he feared catching a &ldquo;chill&rdquo;.  He comes to regret this decision because the closer he gets to the commune, the  more &ldquo;choked&rdquo; he becomes. Significantly, Naipaul&rsquo;s breathing restrictions once  again coincide with the call to prayer. Like Imaduddin before him, Saleem  deserts the afflicted Naipaul in order to worship (316). When Saleem returns,  he takes Naipaul to his study and library. It is at this point in the journey  that Naipaul encounters yet another set of &ldquo;Islamic books&rdquo;: &ldquo;Half the wall facing the door carried those Islamic sets in  decorated binding [&hellip;]. I soon stopped looking at the books. I began to choke in  the stale, enclosed air. I felt I was becoming ill&rdquo; (317). The room of &ldquo;Islamic learning&rdquo; appears to be drained of  oxygen. We are told that it is &ldquo;entirely sealed&rdquo;. Naipaul tries to rectify this  immediately and asks someone to open the window and switch the &ldquo;air-cleaner&rdquo; on.  Sitting on the only chair in the room, one brought up at his specific request,  he sits by the window, inhales some slightly less polluted air, and begins to  recover. However, the relief he enjoys is short-lived.</p>
              <p>Naipaul&rsquo;s breathing restriction reaches its peak during the  following dialogue in which Saleem proudly introduces his young son: 
            <blockquote>Saleem said, &ldquo;He is going to learn the whole Koran by heart.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;The whole Koran,&rdquo; the old man said, picking up the duet with his son.<br>
              I asked, &ldquo;How long will that take?&rdquo;<br>
              Saleem said, &ldquo;Five or six years.&rdquo;<br>
              I couldn&rsquo;t  stay. My breathing had become very bad. Downstairs, the servants, thin and dark  and dingy, behind the sacks with the split golden paddy. Outside, the fumes and  grit of the Multan  road. Saleem&rsquo;s driver drove me back to the hotel. Saleem didn&rsquo;t come with me.  (321) </blockquote>
            So  violent is Naipaul&rsquo;s reaction in the Akram household that he is unable to stay  and hear Saleem&rsquo;s little boy recite a couple of verses. Instead, he is forced  to flee back to the safety of his hotel in Lahore. </p>
              <p>As one can see from these passages, the narrator&rsquo;s  fear of Islamic literature, mosques, indeed, any form of Muslim worship, are  clearly reflected in both his physical environment and personal ailments. Poor  air-quality is an indicator of the presence of Islam and timely asthmatic  responses reveal the narrator&rsquo;s irrepressible hostility towards Muslims. Fawzia  Mustafa observes that Naipaul uses &ldquo;physical discomfort [...] as a gauge for  reading the functioning, or completeness, or societal health of the place in  which he finds himself&rdquo; (Mustafa 79). However, she curiously fails to mention  that physical discomfort reaches its peak when Naipaul is in the presence of  the &ldquo;believers&rdquo;. Muslims of various persuasions, traditions and character, or  simply their <em>possibly</em> Islamic artefacts, induce violent physical  responses from this narrator of supposed &ldquo;moral integrity&rdquo;. In <em>Beyond Belief</em>,  the presence of practising Muslims compels the narrator to rush out of &ldquo;interviews&rdquo;,  escape &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; atmospheres, reach for &ldquo;air-cleaners&rdquo;, and struggle to open  windows in search of fresh air. Though it may well be true that Naipaul &ndash; the  man &ndash; &nbsp;has a sensitive physical  disposition, his commitment to this particular aspect of Victorian fiction  helps to explain the persistence of faith-dependent air quality, the narrator&rsquo;s  regular bouts of asthma, and their sudden onset in the presence of practising Muslims. </p>
              <p>The presence of  gothic realism in Naipaul&rsquo;s &ldquo;Islamic travelogue&rdquo; is multifaceted in its effects.  Occasionally, the narrator is abandoned to the dictates of gothic realism so  completely it produces rather humorous results. The typical plot of the gothic  novel is that of the delicate but curious heroine who is lured into the  ancestral home of a seemingly innocent but fearsomely dangerous count or  aristocrat. Naipaul recycles this plot, placing his traveller&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rdquo; at the  centre. It goes like this. The inquisitive Naipaul visits Imaduddin&rsquo;s house in  order to &ldquo;hear a little more about his past &ndash; his ancestry&rdquo; (41). But Naipaul  arrives late and, to his disdain, is left to wait in an empty room. Once again,  he fulfils the familiar role of &ldquo;realist observer&rdquo; and describes the objects surrounding  him:
            <blockquote>On the pillars of the sitting room there were two or three decorative  little flower pieces and, surprisingly, a picture of a sailing ship. About the  sitting room were small mementoes of foreign travel, tourist souvenirs, showing  a softer side of Imaduddin (or his wife), a side not connected with mental  training, if indeed the house was theirs, and if their mementoes had truly  tugged at their hearts (and did not, rather, preserve the memory of some pious  giver) (Naipaul 1998, 42-43) </blockquote>
            As the description develops, the language  becomes increasingly gothic in style. On the surface, the room has the  appearance of familiarity, even comfort, but there is the suggestion that this  might just be a deceptive cover. In the narrator&rsquo;s &nbsp;view, Islamic education (&ldquo;mental training&rdquo;) is  simply not compatible with a love of travel, sentimentality, or a liking for  nautical scenes. Therefore, the collection of &lsquo;sentimental objects&rdquo; become  suspect and Naipaul doubts whether the house actually belongs to Imaduddin and  his wife. The implication is that these comforting artefacts are being  displayed in order to lure Naipaul into a false sense of security. The narrator&rsquo;s  nerves get the better of him and he begins to experience a deep sense of panic:  &ldquo;how long [&hellip;] should I stay where I was, violating the house, and how when the  time came [&hellip;] might I get away from the curious trap I had appeared to have  fallen into&rdquo; (43). This passage could have been lifted straight out of Jane  Austen&rsquo;s <em>Northanger Abbey </em>or Brahm Stoker&rsquo;s<em> Dracula</em>. Naipaul, in  his loyalty to the gothic narrative, has written his traveller&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rdquo; into the  role of a vulnerable, innocent heroine at the mercy of a dark lord. As if aware  of the narrative trap that he has fallen foul of, and the weak narrative  position that he has been accorded, the narrator attempts to recover narratorial  authority with a well-used Naipaulian weapon: a toilet joke. Having discovered  Imaduddin was engaging in nothing more menacing than having a massage, the  narrator claims he had suspected Imaduddin&rsquo;s &ldquo;bathroom problems&rdquo; were the cause  of his wait all along (43). However, the mark of the gothic genre in the text is usually more disturbing in its  effects. 
              <p>Gothic language is used to portray both Islam and Muslims  throughout <em>Beyond Belief </em>and its powers of manipulation are alarming. In  the section on Indonesia,  Islam is described as having spread in a Dracula-like fashion: &ldquo;Islam had come  here not long before Europe. It had not been  the towering force it had been in other converted places. [&hellip;] It had not  completely possessed the souls of people&rdquo; (24). According  to the text, Indonesia  only narrowly escaped this ghoulish fate. We need only glance at the description  of Muslims (or &ldquo;possessed souls&rdquo;) answering the adhan in order to see the  importance of the gothic genre in Naipaul&rsquo;s narration.
            <blockquote>Within the  office, no doubt from the carpeted and rumpled open space at the end of the  corridor, hesitant scraping sounds developed into a shy chant. [&hellip;] The<strong> </strong>chanting  from the corridor became more confident. It couldn&rsquo;t be denied now. I could see  that Imaduddin wanted to be out there, with the chanters and the prayers. The  chanting now filled the corridor [&hellip;] he couldn&rsquo;t be held back. (18-20)&nbsp; </blockquote>
            This passage is  infused with gothic tension: the &ldquo;hesitant scraping sounds&rdquo; and rising &ldquo;chants&rdquo;  suggest the actions of a frightening and possibly sub-human sect rather than a  group of Muslims at prayer. Muslims don&rsquo;t chant before beginning the main  prayer. If a Muslim arrives early, he or she might do two rakats (bowing  cycles), but this is always done in silence. It does not involve &ldquo;hesitant  scraping sounds&rdquo;. In Naipaul&rsquo;s view, by merely answering the call to prayer,  Imaduddin reveals himself to be one of the walking dead, a mindless being  seduced against his will. (Notably, those who are <em>not</em> Muslims in <em>Beyond Belief</em> are repeatedly referred to as  being &ldquo;their own men.&rdquo;) As in numerous instances in the text, the use of gothic  imagery tells us more about the narrator&rsquo;s fears and prejudices than about &ldquo;reality&rdquo;.  This can also be seen in a later description of the character Saleem. When Saleem  hears the adhan, he is described as responding in a spasmodic and zombie-like  fashion: &ldquo;in sudden haste&rdquo; he &ldquo;took off his tie and threw his jacket on the car  seat and went to join in the prayers.&rdquo; (316) That Muslims are captured souls at  the mercy of a mind numbing and unstoppable force is a persistent theme in  Naipaul&rsquo;s text. According to the narrator, &ldquo;cultural depression&rdquo; causes &ldquo;religious  teaching and a knowledge of Islam&rdquo; to flourish. Learning how to recite <em>The Qu&rsquo;ran</em>, &ldquo;how to have ablution&rdquo; and &ldquo;how  to do the right prayers&rdquo;, we are told, &nbsp;involves an &ldquo;isolating and beating down and  stunning of the mind&rdquo;, a &ldquo;kind of pain&rdquo; (34). Once again, it is suggested that Muslims  are like the living dead, their brains anaesthetized by pain and suffering. This  theme is extended when Naipaul describes the theological school of Qom.  Naipaul&rsquo;s translator, Mehrdad, informs him that &ldquo; &lsquo;special night prayers  involve a lot of bowing and rubbing of the forehead against the earth.&rdquo; &ldquo;  Naipaul describes these &ldquo;very pious people&rdquo; as having &lsquo;something like a scorch  mark on their forehead; this was because they heated the cakes of earth for  their prayers&rdquo; (238). The underlying references have a powerful impact. Muslims,  with their scorched foreheads, answer the call to prayer in zombie like  fashion. The women who walk through the streets of this centre of learning are  described in an equally sinister manner. Like enslaved creatures, they &ldquo;held  the chador over their face with their hands or bit an end of it between their  teeth; they looked like people who were muzzling themselves.&rdquo; (217) Though it  is traditional in a number of cultures for women (especially those of the older  generation) to hold their headscarf between their teeth, the language infers  that it proves these &lsquo;subhuman&rdquo; women have given up their souls and are  suffering torturous consequences. The presence of the gothic genre in these  passages reinforces the opinion that political Islam is &ldquo;a complete form of  control&rdquo; that &ldquo;deform[s] people&rsquo;s lives&rdquo; (240). </p>
              <p>The  narrator fails to comment on the fact that, in the same areas in which he  identifies this frightening &ldquo;form of control&rdquo;, non-Islamic practices abound.  For example, he encounters brothels, the caste system, local superstitions,  fast-breakers, scantily clad women, military dictatorships and so on. Furthermore,  and as Amin Malak remarks in response to Naipaul&rsquo;s earlier travelogue: 
            <blockquote>Two of the four  countries &ndash; Pakistan and Indonesia &ndash; are under military dictatorships,  the third (Iran) is  undergoing a revolutionary process, and the fourth (Malaysia) is suffering from racial  tension [&hellip;]. No wonder then that his search for Islamic institutions or Islamic  law in practice becomes an exercise in futility, it would be hard to imagine  stable and legitimate social structures existing, let alone functioning, in the  political climates of the four countries visited. (Malak 1984, 565)</blockquote>
            Nevertheless, the  narrator persists in his claim that all the ills of the people he meets have  their origin in Islam. The text&rsquo;s message is clear: non-Arab Muslims are to be  pitied because they have given away their souls. </p>
              <p>It is no accident that <em>Beyond Belief</em> frequently  reads like a gothic novel. The gothic genre is dominated by vulnerable  characters who submit their will, often subconsciously, to a higher demonic  force that feeds off their life blood and leaves them void. In the narrator&rsquo;s view,  the men who are &ldquo;unable to resist&rdquo; the call to prayer and the women who &ldquo;muzzle  themselves&rdquo; have signed such a contract of submission and have agreed to abolish  &ldquo;the self&rdquo;. Although I have warned against the unproblematised conflation of  the &ldquo;Naipaul &ndash; the narrator &ldquo; with &ldquo;Naipaul &ndash; the man&rdquo;, such conflations are  clearly encouraged by Naipaul&rsquo;s public appearances. At a reading of his book <em>Half  a Life</em> at Queen Elizabeth Hall in October 2001, Naipaul claimed that &ldquo;Islam&rdquo;  demanded an &ldquo;abolition of the self&rdquo; that &ldquo;was worse than the similar colonial  abolition of identity [&hellip;] much, much worse in fact.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> The narrator in <em>Beyond Belief</em> similarly  asserts that &ldquo;converted peoples have to strip  themselves of their past; of converted peoples nothing is required but the  purest faith (if such a thing can be arrived at), Islam, submission. It is the  most uncompromising kind of imperialism&rdquo; (Naipaul 1998, 72). Naipaul the narrator and Naipaul the man, repeatedly assert  that Islam demands that people annul their individuality. With regards to Pakistan, the  narrator argues that &ldquo;the fundamentalists wanted people to be  transparent, pure, to be empty vessels for the faith. It was an impossibility:  human beings could never be blanks in that way.&rdquo; (311) Yet, we are told, such  people exist. Those who are &ldquo;empty&rdquo;, those who are suffering from cultural  depression and an ignorance about their past are identified as being those most  &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of conversion. In the narrator&rsquo;s view, certain people or cultures are  more vulnerable to Islam than others. For example, in <em>Beyond Belief </em>the narrator states that Indonesians are susceptible  to conversion because &ldquo;they have no idea of themselves.&rdquo; (72) A vacuum of  identity is stipulated as being the ideal environment in which Islam can  prosper. Like the weak and vulnerable women that faint and submit to  blood-sucking vampires in the gothic novel, Naipaul&rsquo;s text suggests that  non-Arab Muslims, with their delicate mental constitutions, have inadvertently  become the living dead.</p>
              <p>Naipaul&rsquo;s  evident concern with the mental health of Muslims constitutes another area of  similarity between <em>Beyond Belief</em> and Victorian literature. Although not  a genre as such, mental instability became a preoccupation in nineteenth  century fiction, reaching its peak towards the latter part of the century.  Instead of locking madness in the attic (such is the fate of Bertha Mason, the &ldquo;madwoman&rdquo;  in <em>Jane Eyre</em>), <em>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</em> novels brought madness downstairs to  be &ldquo;analysed&rdquo;. Central characters become increasingly &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; and even those  marginal characters that are included in order to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; the afflicted begin to  show signs of insanity. For example, one of the doctors of psychiatry in <em>Dracula</em> becomes slowly addicted to drugs whilst the other is prone to alarming bouts of  hysteria. This ambiguous line between madness and sanity can also be seen in  Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s <em>The Heart of Darkness</em> and Wilkie Collins&rsquo; <em>The Woman  in White</em>. The readiness to address the causes, symptoms and fluidity of  madness in literature ran parallel to the increasingly influential academic  discipline of psychiatry. During this period, the language of psychiatrists  such as Andrew Wynter (<em>The Borderlands of Insanity</em>,1875) and  Henry Maudsley (<em>The Pathology of the </em>Mind, 1895), and later, Sigmund  Freud, entered into popular discourse (Chamberlain and Gilman). Reflecting  contemporary cultures&rsquo; anxieties, characters in these novels regularly slip in  and out of madness, experiencing hysteria, degeneration, insanity and other  newly defined (or redefined) psychological states. In much <em>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</em> literature, characters and narrators utilise the discourse of psychology in  order to authoritatively &ldquo;define&rdquo; and explain the psychological states of  others. Such &ldquo;mental assessments&rdquo; are not confined to those &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; to  offer opinions. Madness is such a pervasive discourse that everyone, including  the patients, is eager to practice amateur psychology. For example, in <em>Dracula</em>, Dr Seward classifies the character  Renfield as a &ldquo;zoophagous patient&rdquo; (explained by his penchant for eating flies)  (Stoker 115). However, between fly eating episodes the &ldquo;pet lunatic&rdquo; Renfield  asserts: &ldquo;Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot help  but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards  the errors of <em>non caus&aelig; </em>and <em>ignoration elenchi</em>&rdquo; (233). In <em>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</em> literature, authors eagerly experiment with this new authoritative discourse of  the mind and narrators and characters alike define and classify the liberal  spread of madness with &lsquo;scientific&rdquo; enthusiasm. Yet again, Naipaul does not  fail in his allegiance to nineteenth century fiction. Whilst travelling in the &ldquo;Muslim  world&rdquo;, his traveller&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rdquo; regularly faces &ldquo;irrational behaviour&rdquo; and is quick  to offer his diagnosis regarding the mental health of the &ldquo;converted peoples&rdquo;: 
              <blockquote>Islam is in its origins an Arab  religion. Everyone not an Arab who is a Muslim is a convert. Islam is not  simply a matter of conscience or private belief. It makes imperial demands. A  convert&rsquo;s world view alters. His holy places are in Arab lands; his sacred  language is Arabic. His idea of history alters. He rejects his own; he becomes,  whether he likes it or not, a part of the Arab story. The convert has to turn  away from everything that is his. The disturbance for societies is immense, and  even after a thousand years can remain unresolved; the turning away has to be  done again and again. People develop fantasies about who and what they are; and  in the Islam of converted countries there is an element of neurosis and  nihilism. These countries can be easily set on the boil. (Naipaul 1998, 1) </blockquote>
            <p>Neurosis, a tendency towards nihilism,  self-delusions, latent aggression and fantasy lives are, according to the  narrator, characteristics of these simmering Muslims.  Of Pakistan,  we are told:
            <blockquote>The local people would hardly be  there, in their own land, or would be there only as ciphers swept aside by the  agents of the faith. It is a dreadful mangling of history. It is a convert&rsquo;s  view; that is all that can be said for it. History has become a kind of  neurosis. Too much has to be ignored or angled; there is too much fantasy. This  fantasy isn&rsquo;t in the books alone; it affects people&rsquo;s lives. (329)&nbsp; </blockquote>
            Islam is found guilty of inducing mental illness on a national scale  because it is an &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; religion with sacred places in Arab lands. According to  this peculiar thesis, Arabs do not suffer from neurosis because they are not &ldquo;converts.&rdquo;  The narrator fails to mention that Arabs were generally polytheists at the time  of the prophet Muhammad and in order to become Muslim necessarily &ldquo;converted.&rdquo;  Perhaps this point is dismissed because the narrator believes that the &lsquo;sacred  places&rdquo; of Arabs are &ldquo;in their own lands&rdquo;? Assuming that this is the reasoning,  it would follow that European and American Christians and Jews suffer from a  similar &ldquo;neurosis&rdquo; because their &ldquo;sacred places&rdquo; are abroad. However, it is  clear that in the narrator&rsquo;s opinion, Western Christians and Jews are mentally  sound. The logic behind Naipaul&rsquo;s argument is impossible to follow. As Eqbal  Ahmed asks, 
            <blockquote>Who is not a convert? By Naipaul&rsquo;s definition, if Iranians are  converted Muslims, then Americans are converted Christians, the Japanese are  converted Buddhists, and the Chinese, large numbers of them, are converted  Buddhists as well. Everybody is converted because at the beginning every  religion had only a few followers. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, all  prophetic religions developed through conversion. In that sense, his organising  thesis should not exclude anyone. (Ahmad 9-10) </blockquote>
            Michael Gilsenan dismisses the argument that  non-Arab Muslims suffer from &ldquo;neurosis&rdquo; with the accusation that this line of  reasoning is made of &lsquo;shallow stuff&rdquo; (Gilsenan 1998). The narrator&rsquo;s attempts  to identify and explain &ldquo;the irrational energies of the faith&rdquo; (Barnouw 61  &amp; 63)<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a> are poorly reasoned and his pains to assume the role of psychiatrist are less  convincing than his literary predecessors.
              <p>In <em>Beyond Belief</em>, a variety of  narrative techniques &ndash; a number of which are found in the gothic novel &ndash;  combine to create a disturbing portrayal of the Muslim world. Literary  conventions persuade us to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in the transparency of the text,  particularly in the character of the vulnerable yet &ldquo;honest narrator&rdquo;, with  whose sufferings we are encouraged to sympathise. These sufferings are  repeatedly provoked by mosques, the call to prayer, Islamic literature, Islamic  dress and Muslim households. All generate an oppressive and suffocating  atmosphere; one that results in choking fits, breathing restrictions and a  compulsion to escape. Naipaul&rsquo;s use of Victorian literary conventions are  rhetorically powerful and it is difficult for the reader to resist sharing the  narrator&rsquo;s relief when windows are opened and uncontaminated non-Muslim fresh  air is available once more. Having seduced the reader in this manner, the text  becomes increasingly gothic in style. As we all know, the gothic genre is  designed to terrify. Gothic novels teem with demonic forces that clamour to  possess the souls of the weak and vulnerable. Bloodthirsty vampires and  immortal beasts take over the minds of their victims and threaten civilisation,  reason, modernity and sanity. By studying the text&rsquo;s depiction of eerie Muslim  households, threatening Islamic artefacts, and brainwashed Muslims at prayer,  one can see how the presence of the gothic genre helps to create a powerful  piece of propaganda. Followers of Islam are repeatedly referred to as being violent  and irrational, numbed by pain, and suffering from a nihilistic form of  neurosis. </p>
<p> Of course, one could read the text  subversively: there is no compunction to be beguiled by the narrative. In fact,  one could argue that the realist conventions (that create the illusion of  transparency) are simultaneously undermined by strategies of representation  that draw attention to the allegiances and biases of the narrator. Unlike many  mid-Victorian travel books, the narrator in <em>Beyond Belief</em> refuses to  efface his own presence and the text often highlights his integral role in the  scene of representation. By identifying incoherencies and contradictions in the  text, it is therefore possible to read <em>Beyond Belief </em>without aligning  with imperialism or Islamophobia. Unfortunately, this is not how Naipaul&rsquo;s  Islamic excursions have been read. </p>
              <p>Contemporary western metropolitan culture chooses  to overlook the narrative strategies and contradictions in Naipaul&rsquo;s Islamic  travel narratives, preferring to ignore their strikingly gothic character. This  is perhaps best typified by the judges&rsquo; comments on awarding Naipaul the Nobel  Prize in October 2001. The Academy declared that Naipaul had been chosen  because he had produced &lsquo;the most outstanding work in an ideal direction&rsquo; and  united &lsquo;perceptive narrative&rsquo; with &lsquo;incorruptible scrutiny.&rsquo;<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> Could gothic horror really be confused with transparent objectivity! Unfortunately,  naive readings that fail to question the travel narrator&rsquo;s claim to &lsquo;truth&rsquo; <em>or</em> engage with the narrative strategies  that constitute the text persist when <em>Beyond  Belief </em>is at the centre of discussion. In these very difficult times, when  relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims are fraught with tension,  suspicion and mistrust, such lazy literary engagement is surely cause for  concern?</p>
