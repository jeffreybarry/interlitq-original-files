                  <td class="texto2" valign="top"><p><span lang="EN-US">After  graduating from London University (Birkbeck College) at the age of 17,  and then from Christ Church, Oxford (with Firsts from both), Theodore  Zeldin helped to build up St Antony's College, Oxford as the  university's postgraduate centre for international studies, and was its  Dean for thirteen years. </span></p>
                    <span lang="EN-US">His history books have focused on the role of the individual and of the emotions in every aspect of life. His 2000 page <em>History of French Passions</em>, in five volumes: <em>Ambition and Love</em>, <em>Intellect and Pride</em>, <em>Taste and Corruption</em>, <em>Anxiety and Hypocrisy</em>, <em>Politics and Anger</em>,  won Britain's top historical award, the Wolfson Prize. It also gave him  a unique status as "the most popular Englishman in France" (Le Point).  He is frequently invited to speak on French radio and television, and  to French business and public authorities. He was president of the  Nord-Pas-de-Calais Planning Commission in 1993-5, adviser to the French  Millennium Commission, and presenter of the Prime Minister's web site.  He has been made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters of France  and called "the world's foremost authority on Frenchness" by Time  Magazine.</span>
                    <p><span lang="EN-US">His book on <em>Happiness</em>, his <em>Intimate History of Humanity</em> and his BBC lectures on Conversation marked the expansion of his  research to the art of living. His writings have been translated into  24 languages. He became a member of the BBC Brains Trust and made a  Commander of the Order of the British Empire.</span></p>
                    <p><span lang="EN-US">His  project on The Future of Work, initiated with support from the European  Commission, inaugurated his development of a new model for business.  Picked as an international thought leader by Fast Company, and as "one  of Britain's leading intellects" by Management Today's New Guru Guide,  he has been active in the executive leadership programmes of Templeton  College Oxford and been made a Professor honoris causa of HEC, the  Paris Business School, and a Fellow of the World Economic Forum. He has  been invited to address and advise top decision-makers in finance, law,  medicine, IT, consulting, transport, manufacturing, design, arts,  advertising, government, and international organisations. The  Independent on Sunday named him as one of the forty world figures whose  ideas could have "a lasting relevance in the new millennium".</span></p>
                    <p><span lang="EN-US">He  is a Patron of the new National Academy of Writing, on the Management  Committee of the Society of Authors, a Trustee of the Wytham Hall  Medical Charity for the Homeless and the Amar International Appeal for  refugees, co-founder and chairman of the Oxford Food Symposium for the  study of international gastronomy. He has been a visiting professor at  Harvard and the University of Southern California, and has lectured in  15 countries.</span></p>
                    <p><span lang="EN-US">He  is married to Deirdre Wilson, the co-inventor of the Theory of  Relevance. They live in an Art Deco House outside Oxford. His hobbies  are painting, gardening and mending things.</span></p>
