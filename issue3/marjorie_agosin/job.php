                She loved <br>
                to imagine the<br>
                fortune-teller<br>
                with her open hands<br>
                with her riot of<br>
                cracks and stories<br>
				<br>
                She dreamed <br>
                of the woman&#8217;s hand,<br>
                woven together with her own<br>
                entering and exiting along estuaries<br>
                barefoot watersheds <br>
                pausing at the line of her heart<br>
                a curving line<br>
                generous<br>
                delightful<br>

                The fortuneteller also possessed <br>
                the most dazzling power!<br>
                Caressing a hand without haste, <br>
                knowing how to pronounce the precise word<br>
                the divinity of a thrilling future<br>
                but more than palms<br>
                the fortuneteller knew how <br>

                <strong>Bodies</strong><br>

                the bodies appeared <br>
                among the bushes, <br>
                in the irrigation ditches <br>
                where the earth deprived of hope <br>
                had drunk the water<br>
                they appeared in the deserts <br>
                like ghostly apparitions <br>
                in the stubborn expansion of the sands<br>
                where there still remained a moan <br>
                a breath of life&#8230; <br>
                the bodies, each one of them, impoverished, <br>
                with arms cut off, faces carved up<br>
                and still, always, the mothers, <br>
                sisters. cousins, the women of the country, <br>
                searching for that body that was no longer a body, <br>
                only debris and desolation. <br>
                time suspended in horror<br>
                when they discovered these bodies<br>
                the women repeated rigorously <br>
                the dignified ritual of death <br>
                that was the ritual of farewell, <br>
                and sometimes, in the middle of the desert, <br>
                of the irrigation ditches, <br>
                of a country closed forever by fear <br>
                they brought flowers <br>
                that also died at the moment of farewell, <br>
                but they were fragile flowers <br>
                claiming the moment of beauty, <br>
                the moment of life before the farewell<br>

				More than anything<br>
                I love the word<br>
                cover<br>
                that entwines bodies<br>
                that covers the dead<br>

                children<br>
                more than anything<br>
                the word<br>
                cover diaphanous<br>
                infinite<br>
                blue upon the beds of those who love<br>
                a cover for covering<br>
                stretching out<br>
                loving like that, between the covers<br>
                biting them<br>
                inhabiting them<br>
                dreaming of them on top of them<br>
                as if they were the land of joy<br>
                and yet, if we are the same<br>
                everything and nothing is sacred<br>

                <strong>Gifts</strong><br>
				<br>
                I offer you a sign<br>
                what the sea does not<br>
                devour<br>
                algae dressed as indolent <br>
                and secretive women<br>
                a seashell that rests its mother-of-pearl <br>
                ears upon the damp sand,<br>
                I want you to hear it,<br>
                I want you to recognize each one of its<br>
                invisible sounds<br>
                I want you to understand<br>
                the wind that rests in it<br>
                and loves<br>
				<br>
                amazing astonishing <br>
                starfish also<br>
                rest on the imaginary country of the sand<br>
				<br>
                I make you a gift of my time and my laughter<br>
                so you will burst with that gratuitous <br>
                joy<br>
                joy of gestures like a luminous ring<br>
                joy of the brilliance<br>
                of a summer day<br>
                when the sea performs its mysterious ceremonies<br>
				<br>
                I offer you my voice <br>
                and my silence<br>
                so you will not confuse it <br>
                with the multitude<br>
                so you will distinguish me<br>
                among so many others<br>
                voice like your asylum<br>
                voice like a bay which<br>
                in the distance gently sways <br>
                welcoming you<br>
                voice of illuminated <br>
                firefly<br>
				<br>
                Because love demands<br>
                the subtleties of recognition<br>
                the quiet haven of a body<br>
                image of another body<br>
                but always uniquely singular<br>
                distracted imprecise<br>
                reminder<br>
				<br>
                Come to my body<br>
                as though you might meet a country <br>
                governed by the rhythm of women<br>
                where the nights do not devour either children<br>
                or stories<br>
                but are tales in the torn heart of the moon <br>
				<br>
                Come to my body that<br>
                does not long for power or borders<br>
                a body that does not return from any war<br>
                that does not hesitate faced with a caress<br>
                that is round<br>
                that weaves fabrics<br>
                children<br>
                secrets like the ochre color of the earth<br>
                like the calypso of enchantments<br>
				<br>
                Here I carve out a paradise among the<br>
                seeds<br>
                that germinate in the open palms <br>
                of my hands<br>

              <p align="left"><br>
                <strong>The Disappeared</strong><br>
				<br>
                The disappeared<br>
                took their voices with them<br>
                their voices with which they sang<br>
                <em>The International</em><br>
                their tongues and languages<br>
				<br>
                We became accustomed to not hearing them<br>
                while we searched for them<br>
                perhaps secretly<br>
                we dreamt that some day<br>
                they would be waiting for us at the corner caf&eacute;<br>
                or in the schoolyard<br>
                as if nothing had happened <br>
                because it was a bad dream in some<br>
                short story by Borges<br>
				<br>
                With them we also lost the transparency <br>
                of objects<br>
                the illusion of every day<br>
                that it was always the present the moment<br>
                the transparency of objects<br>
				<br>
                And so we grew accustomed to filling ourselves with absence<br>
                to a gray silence on our cracked faces<br>
                to forgetting their voices<br>
                to really believing that perhaps not one of them existed<br>
                that these disappeared<br>
                were not real<br>
				<br>
                And so we too disappeared from history<br>
                we shriveled up<br>
                the sky also smaller<br>
                we no longer searched for anyone<br>
                we did not question anyone<br>
                we grew silent in order to die or perhaps to live in miniature<br>
                and one day like them<br>
                we also disappeared<br>
                except that<br>
                we were aware<br>
                we dressed in mourning<br>
                we joined forces with fear<br>
                little by little indifference defeated us too<br>
				<br>
                We expected nothing else<br>
                except occasionally thinking <em>yes</em>,<br>
                perhaps they would again appear in that corner caf&eacute;<br>
                or in that instant of the sun when summer is a<br>
                ceremony of delight.<br>

              <p align="left"><br>
                <strong>Here I Dreamed of Myself</strong><br>
				<br>
                Here I dreamed of myself<br>
                I sketched seashells <br>
                In the palms of my hands.<br>
				<br>
                I learned the clear<br>
                Sounds that taught me <br>
                To know myself <br>
                In the simple truth of being<br>
                In the present moment<br>
				<br>
                And with these words<br>
                Simple necklaces are embroidered<br>
                Language demands humility<br>
                Tenderness in the telling of tales<br>
				<br>
                It was impossible not to be the accomplice<br>
                Of poetry<br>
                There was too much maddening magic<br>
                In this geography <br>
                Six hundred sighing volcanoes<br>
				<br>
                Caves with dancing animals<br>
                Avenues of glaciers like the capitals of a<br>
                Decrepit Europe<br>
				<br>
                I fell in love with the names of birds<br>
                And what their flights foretold but I loved<br>
                The huemul<sup>1</sup> like my grandmother Gabriela<br>
                Because I was more awkward than it.<br>
				<br>
                And I fell in love with my country<br>
                Without great questions<br>
                Only the hope of loving it<br>
                Even in the distance<br>
                When I saw it from the air<br>
                I saw it smaller than myself.<br>
				<br>
                All that I am and love<br>
                Is here<br>
                As in the ancient vessels of the gypsies<br>
                Here even the chorus of the bandurrias<br>
                Here the preamble of love was born.<br>

                <strong>Blue Nostalgia</strong><br>
				<br>
                Blue nostalgia for being recognized<br>
                Discovering the world among the others<br>
                Growing old with them<br>
                Sensing the continuity of history<br>
                Delighting in lovers who left<br>
                With another<br>
                Being a very old woman<br>
                The same one who fell in love<br>
                With her own dreams<br>
                The one who sketched tattoos in <br>
                Imaginary sands<br>
                And watered the graves of her grandparents<br>
				<br>
                Nostalgia for recognizing a fragrance that<br>
                Blooms among the herbs of the same house<br>
                Where the rain marched calmly past<br>
                While Serrat accompanied the first<br>
                Enchantments of love<br>
				<br>
                I have lived here so far away<br>
                Abandoning the girl I was<br>
                Only nostalgia for a blue day<br>
                For a house where I lay my head<br>
                For a country that offered me words<br>
				<br>
                Beyond the hours<br>
				<br>
                And the wind beyond, within the solitude of fire<br>
                Became a perpetual guest<br>
                A clear presence among the absent ones<br>
				<br>
                Beyond the hours<br>
                The wind and its voice waving along the shores<br>
                Showing us the grace of remoteness<br>
                In the sunny solitudes of Chile<br>
                Where I too became <br>
                A guest and accomplice<br>
                A silence without preamble<br>
                A hoarse and obscure voice<br>
                A voice<br>
                </p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                <strong>The Sound of Love</strong><br>
				<br>
                Dazzling is this whispering<br>
                of pulsations<br>
                this blinking of light<br>
                this sound of love<br>
                populating the skin<br>
                depopulating fear<br>
                so like the path<br>
                that appears to take delight <br>
                in wonders<br>
				<br>
                Dazzling are the bodies<br>
                entwining themselves in the clandestine<br>
                circle of a reddish spark<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                <strong>Snowflakes</strong><br>
				<br>
                Winter also <br>
                Is rejoicing<br>
                A shaky stillness over the grasslands<br>
                A country overflowing in its luminous<br>
                Geography<br>
                You touch the avatar of winter<br>
                Like a guest,<br>
                Astonished before a spinning<br>
                Delicate<br>
                Transitory<br>
                Transparency<br>
                And the trees <br>
                You would embrace every summer<br>
                As if they were the waists of lovers, of small<br>
                Children<br>
                Now, so naked, so generous<br>
                Weaving silences<br>
                Weaving stories<br>
                And your hair also seems<br>
                To slip away among the trees<br>
                I imagine you arriving home<br>
                The wind pronouncing your name<br>
                Sunken in the white texture<br>
                And you come because I wait for you<br>
                Like the women who wait after the rains<br>
                After the floods<br>
                After the war<br>
                And you enter my body like a smile<br>
                In this abundant winter<br>
                The body sketches wandering fires<br>
                In the distance silence and birds in love with silence<br>
                And without seeking one another<br>
                We return to each other<br>
                Unable to distinguish between outside and inside<br>
                The body is a house in the solitude of a day between snowfalls<br>
                In the plenitude of the sun above our caresses<br>
                And I tell you stories of my country closer to the sun than to 
                sadness<br>
                And I ruffle your hair like a gentle snowflake falling <br>
                On that pillow even more transparent than the story you and I 
                imagined<br>
              </p>

                <strong>Journeys</strong><br>
				<br>
                I have traveled through the countryside <br>
                with your name<br>
                I have entered uninhabited cities<br>
                where birds die at night<br>
                I have asked about your face<br>
                among the mute<br>
                the women who only gaze bewilderedly<br>
                at the horizon<br>
                I have traveled with you and your name<br>
                in search of your light<br>
                I have repeated your name until<br>
                I became a dream lost on the plains<br>
                and no one responds, no one recognizes<br>
                no one inquires<br>
                only your name <br>
                on my dry lips<br>
                only your name that recalls you<br>
                touching essences, awakening alone<br>
                with your name like ashes that overshadow the light.</p>
