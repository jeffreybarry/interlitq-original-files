Don&rsquo;t ask for a special bullet,<br>
Even a puppy&rsquo;s considered more worthy<br>
And none of the marksmen who revel in death<br>
Would toss you a toast down his gullet.<br>
No knife is whet for those we forget<br>
So be damned as a dog or a bitch,<br>
And your wounded brother will bare his teeth<br>
To hear you whine in his ditch.<br>
He&rsquo;ll lick his wounds, for his time has come,<br>
He won&rsquo;t wait for an answering call,<br>
And to cast a bullet for such as him -<br>
            The world has no silver at  all.

		  I hope there&#8217;ll be grass enough for 
              a Przhevalsky horse<br>
              Though it&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s shorter than a thousand years 
              ago;<br>
              As for progress, it may be that you are correct, of course,<br>
              But my wife (and you know what some wives are like) says no.<br>
              I weighed up the pros and cons, then looked at a child,<br>
              Thought again, and decided I did not agree to die out,<br>
              To consent to utter extinction was something that riled,<br>
              So lost that there&#8217;s hardly a bone to collect, no doubt!<br>
              Yet you, my friend, are prepared to gather them all?<br>
              I thank you so much, but somehow I&#8217;m used to existing<br>
              By a glacier under a sun that&#8217;s a shaggy ball.<br>
              It&#8217;s an irreversible change? Just because you persist in<br>
              Counting by centuries, things that are too small to weigh<br>
              As the units of fate, which I will not measure; I&#8217;ll stand<br>
              By my former opinion; my tribe, till Judgment Day,<br>
              Will be blowing its pipes at sunset, in my native land.<br>
              Farewell, I wish you plenty of grass and water,<br>
              A very intelligent son and a well-nourished daughter;<br>
              I&#8217;m grateful for your research, and impatient remain<br>
              Till I hear from you in a thousand years again.<br>

              Where am I?<br>
              A question so silly and flaccid,<br>
              But those who are forced not to die<br>
              (With oxygen burning like acid)<br>
              Can scarce move their lips.<br>
              Where am I?<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              So for me, who can never forget the line<br>
              Beyond which no dog can run, no raven can fly,<br>
              To wake up anew: where am I?<br>
              And to see: it is you. Agreed - let it be on this side.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Oh well,<br>
              Let there be the strange ceiling<br>
              I yield<br>
              To the murk - Mordovia&#8217;s or Italy&#8217;s -<br>
              Whose time is this to get up? To feel cold,<br>
              Whose dawn? To be beaten<br>
              Whose anthem, these glory-be&#8217;s?<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              So what?<br>
              Since I rest on your shoulder<br>
              This visit&#8217;s allowed<br>
              In this light, whose grey hues<br>
              Are the nobody&#8217;s hour,<br>
              This &#8216;hello&#8217; - which I need not excuse.<br>

              Rejoice my wild falcon, we&#8217;re given a day to be hunters,<br>
              Rejoice my wild steed; you will not need your bridle today;<br>
              We shall rush the June hills with flight and galloping thunder,<br>
              And at night God will light a huge star to show us our way.<br>
              We&#8217;ll give a generous bag to those whom we seek<br>
              For a roof, and we&#8217;ll give the girl who will wake us from 
              rest<br>
              A sound silver ring; smile love, when you hear falcons shriek,<br>
              If you give birth to a son, send a message poste haste.<br>

              Don&#8217;t count your steps on the track;<br>
              The Great Bear&#8217;s howling above<br>
              Like a bomber&#8217;s spinning dive,<br>
              And in front of you it&#8217;s pitch-black.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              So try not to look straight ahead,<br>
              There&#8217;s nothing but trouble in that,<br>
              Just look at that nifty old lag,<br>
              He knows where to go, the rat.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Click the breech block now,<br>
              Don&#8217;t turn your head, just yelp;<br>
              Your comrade, the Tambov Wolf,<br>
              Will howl from the moon to help.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Your greatcoat&#8217;s scabbed with frost,<br>
              The time to be home&#8217;s long gone,<br>
              But your lips will freeze into &#8220;<em>Schnell</em>!&#8221;,<br>
              As they&#8217;re trying to say &#8220;Move on!&#8221;<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              The old lag&#8217;s nuts, on purpose<br>
              He leaves no marks on the ground,<br>
              And the shadows of your body<br>
              Are facing the wrong way round.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Snow is hugging your fingers<br>
              And now you can&#8217;t pull the trigger!<br>
              &#8220;How long are you in for, mate?&#8221;<br>

				</span>O, iron September,<br>
Children - to schoolrooms,<br>
Apples - to cider presses<br>
And you - to jail;<br>
The sky has put off its stars<br>
And now goes nude;<br>
Most empty the mornings<br>
And everyone shares damn all!<br>
Metal&rsquo;s particularly bare,<br>
No nudist competes,<br>
But it&rsquo;s most obscene when it&rsquo;s covered with  something, like cloth.<br>
At exercise (&ldquo;Hands behind your back!&rdquo;)<br>
Crows meet<br>
To ask if it&rsquo;s right for a free bird<br>
To gulp from the trough<br>
In a human <em>zoo</em>.<br>
They&rsquo;re like a net<br>
In the rigid air, and so the sky grows dun,<br>
Wise feathers are falling lightly, precisely, and yet<br>
Not a single white feather has fallen,<br>
Not a single one.<br>
O, merry September,<br>
The reckless hours<br>
Of semi-avian bones,<br>
You young beggars, be bold!<br>
Hark, century, whom we fostered, as the clock on the  tower<br>
Measures out the ration of heaven,<br>
Salt,<br>
Bread,<br>
Salt.<br>

			  If God&rsquo;s paradise exists, my old<br>
Parrot surely lives there - he who told<br>
Half of Europe&rsquo;s  fortunes, who abused<br>
All mundane authorities, and used<br>
To swear in every language known to man,<br>
Who took his final breath cupped in my hands,<br>
Who pitied no one any more at all,<br>
And I was the only one he called a fool.<br>          &nbsp;<br>

			  White cat padding on his paws, <br>
Rubbing whiskers on the doors, <br>
Tomorrow it is bound to snow<br>
And the house roofs high and low<br>
Will be covered to the beam<br>
All in snow, as in a dream.<br>
The cat has paws, a tail, and tum<br>
Like a fluffy little drum,<br>
Drinks no milk but shows his love<br>
For the snow and clouds above.<br>
Over the moon he walked last night,<br>
His claws became all golden bright,<br>
And his pawmarks could be seen,<br>
For he forgot to lick them clean,<br>
Stretched across the sky so far<br>
That they went from star to star<br>
Then he jumped down, and in a trice<br>
Scared to death the rats and mice,<br>
Sat on the chimney, washed his face<br>
And we will take him to our  place.<br>

  No tree plucked the apple, and so<br>
They&rsquo;re not ashamed to be nude,<br>
They send their leaves, an innocent crew,<br>
Down to those in the basement below.<br>
I see a cloud -<br>
 And you?<br>

  We still live in that wretched year, where it smells<br>
Of carbolic acid, like nursery schools,<br>
Where the paint has been licked off the toys long ago<br>
But they promise to show us a film tomorrow;<br>
Where we&rsquo;re leisurely taught the basic rules -<br>
<em>Sing and dance in a ring</em>, and <em>tears are for fools</em>,<br>
But where every day, when evening came,<br>
One of us, somehow, would cease his playing<br>
And stand at the door, by chance maybe,<br>
Then say in quiet despair,<br>
No, they weren&rsquo;t for me.<br>  &nbsp;<br>

  The storm is past, the flight is cleared,<br>
This time there&rsquo;s no return - off to<br>
A freshly washed world like a chick that&rsquo;s appeared<br>
Still damp - and they&rsquo;ll ask. Is that really you?<br>
And was your journey pleasant and light?<br>
Are there no sorrows in your heart?<br>
What colour are the clouds on the other side<br>
Where you were silent, and apart?<br>  &nbsp;<br>

  Good evening, my boy,<br>
You are on your own again,<br>
Your awkward nib is  tearing once more at the page,<br>
The net curtain&rsquo;s pattern is fretted by light from the  lane;<br>
Like a pogrom the windows are flogged by the winter&rsquo;s  rage.<br>
You have a fit when you read the rubbish you write<br>
And death is childishly tempting and innocent,<br>
But there in the void of the rattle, away from the  light,<br>
Seeds are striking against the round firmament.<br>
The time and the place have still to set themselves  fair<br>
For you to be rising, on high,<br>
And you and your nib -<br>
An inseparable pair- are fated to perish elsewhere:<br>
These seeds will shoot yet, my boy, through each  juvenile rib.              </span></p></td>
