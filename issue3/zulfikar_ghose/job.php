                and was stiflingly heavy with humidity in the summer when the

            <p>Orwell had died two years 
                before I arrived in London in 1952, and it was some years before 
                I read his work. The circumstances of my life, as had his, led 
                me to a literary career and by my twenties I was contributing 
                to the London periodicals and to the B.B.C., as had Orwell before 
                me, and had published my first book. But there the comparison 
            ends between Orwell and myself.</p>
            <p>With Orwell, it is assumed that Motihari in north India was merely the accidental location of his  birth, that essentially Motihari might as well have been some remote village in  England.  The accidental location of my birth, Sialkot in  pre-partition north India,  was in no less remote a place than Motihari. Orwell was in his first year,  still a baby, when he was taken to England;  I grew up in Sialkot and then in Bombay, and was seventeen when my family migrated to England. But  imagine if I had been taken to England  as a baby and Orwell when he was seventeen. </p>
            <p><em>It would have made no  difference at all to what happened next.</em></p>
            <p>He would still be seen as an important English writer and I would  remain where the English placed me soon after I began to publish in London&mdash;somewhere just  outside their peripheral vision where they occasionally see a blur that  sometimes appears to have an interesting definition but remains a blur. </p>
            <p>He was, of course, <em>George  Orwell</em>, a writer of unquestioned greatness. There were other British  writers who were born in India  but whose mediocrity does not make my point as dramatically.</p>
            <p>The point is not altogether to do with racism or colonialism. In  my own experience as a writer, the British have never been racist&mdash;though in  1959, as a person recently graduated from a British university, unlike my white  friends, I found it impossible to get a job. As a writer, I have had nothing  but good relations with editors, literary agents and publishers. What my  experience has shown me is more a question of a primitive form of nationalism  and an instinctive cultural exclusivity by which people are driven to assert  their preference.</p>
            <p>I learned early that I was quite  mistaken in my assumption that people responded only to the quality of one's  work, and mistaken too in thinking that, except of course for the very crucial  distinction of their relative literary merit, there could be no difference  between Orwell and another writer who wrote in the English language. I had  formed the naive notion that people admired Orwell because he wrote an  impeccable prose, had a superior imagination and put across his ideas in  compelling forms, and therefore it seemed to me to follow that anyone else who,  too, showed singular imaginative and intellectual qualities would also be  received with a relatively comparable admiration. Was this not the lesson one  learned from the study of literature, that it provided one with a context  within which to make a rational appraisal of a new writer&rsquo;s work?&nbsp; After learning to appreciate the complex  aesthetics of, for instance, Virginia Woolf and being inspired to emulate her  example, was it presumptuous to believe that one&rsquo;s work would be evaluated on  the same terms as had been hers?</p>
            <p>The occasion that revealed to me that I had indeed been  presumptuous to think so was a poetry reading which a young English poet and I  had been invited to give at a university. The Englishman was not a very good  poet; quite forgettable, in fact&mdash;which has been his subsequent fate. But the  audience, consisting entirely of English students, listened politely to me and  with rapturous attention to him, and I realised that they were not listening  with a discriminating ear but with one that delighted in hearing familiar  native tunes even though they were badly sung. Well, they were <em>discriminating</em>, though they did not  possess a sense of discrimination. They were excited by parochial relevance,  not by a well expressed thought.</p>
            <p>Some years later, I was included in the series called <em>Penguin  Modern Poets</em> &mdash; three poets were represented in each book in this series. I  appeared together with two English poets, Gavin Ewart and B. S. Johnson. The  book was reviewed in the<em> Guardian</em> by  an English poet. He said fine things about Ewart and spoke well of Johnson. He  did not even mention me.</p>
            <p>No, it was not racism but that other great imbecility that  afflicts humanity, nationalism. The native English reluctance to recognise an  alien as using their language with possibly a superior facility than they did  themselves extended also to some people of their own race, the Americans. Some  of the English poets I knew (two or three of them have become eminent in England since  then) dismissed the Americans as irrelevant&mdash;which, of course, was a  comfortingly superior attitude that masked a simmering resentment that the  Americans had produced a new poetry of unmatchable brilliance.</p>
            <p>One of them said that Eliot and Pound had been &lsquo;barking up the  wrong tree&rsquo;, meaning that their attempt to &lsquo;make it new&rsquo; had been a misguided  and foolish endeavour, that real English poetry in the early years of the  century had been written by the group known as the Georgian poets. It was this  attitude that led to the raising of Philip Larkin, a competent poet with a  parochial vision and no intellectual depth, to the status of a national figure,  while the one English poet of real worth, who had learned from Pound and the  Europeans, Basil Bunting, was consigned to obscurity. Larkin was applauded for  suggesting that he knew nothing of foreign poetry. And it was the same nationalistic  glee which had placed a coronet on Larkin's head that crowned Robert Graves,  one of the old Georgians, as England's great poet when in the early 60s he  began to produce quantities of love poems&mdash;all very delicate and charming, but  all rather thin; there was an euphoric sense of relief that there was a native  poet England could be proud of, and both the <em>New Statesman</em> and th<em>e  Observer</em> printed dozens (literally so) of his poems prominently, the latter  once giving the entire front page of its <em>Review</em> section to flaunt this resurrected banner of English poetry with its implicit  rejection of American and European influence.</p>
            <p>Of all the categories into which literature is divided, the worst  is the nationalistic one, especially among writers in the English language,  which is the language of many nations. An implied hierarchy has become  established among English-language writers: it is assumed that those from the  United Kingdom and Ireland and from the U.S.A. are the primary English-language  writers, the mainstream, followed by those from the former British colonies,  like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, whose population until recently was  largely of white British or European origin. Farther down the scale are the  English-language writers from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean  even though they may have become citizens of the countries in the first two  groups or indeed have been born there. Superficially this might appear to be a  racial distinction, and to a degree it is, but essentially its roots are in  nationalism. To give an example where the alien writer in the English midst is  a white European: Joseph Conrad. He was a far greater writer than his  contemporary Thomas Hardy; after some early hesitation, the English <em>accepted</em> Conrad; they <em>embraced</em> Hardy. </p>
            <p>Consider two writers from India: Raja Rao and the Kenyan-born  G. V. Desani. Considered purely from the point of view of language, form and  style, their novels are impressive achievements in the English language. Had  Desani been an Irishman he would be as well known as Flann O&rsquo;Brien. Had Rao  been an American he would have received idolatrous devotion from teachers and  students of literature. Instead, in western countries, one would be lucky to  find their names in university courses other than the ones devoted to that hideous  bureaucratic invention, Third World Literature, courses that are usually taken  by a handful of students from racial minorities or by foreign students  pathetically looking for something with which they can identify. Such courses,  which purport to provide a balanced view, only perpetuate the essential  distortion: they confirm the generally accepted notion that English literature  consists of regional blocks that have no connection with one another and are to  be seen only as pictures of those regions. Without such nationalistic  identification, even this little recognition would be denied Desani and Rao. </p>
            <p>But isn&rsquo;t it sad that such eminent writers as Desani and Rao have  to be placed in a nationalistic category before they can be allocated some  attention? Such a procedure, flaunting a misguided version of liberalism, is a  nearly certain guarantee of the writers remaining neglected. It is like a work  of art which the museum curator, finding no niche for it in the permanent  galleries, places in the storage room and brings it up on some rare occasion  for a temporary exhibition in which it is included not for its beauty but to  make some socio-political point.</p>
            <p>It has sometimes been my experience&mdash;and I've seen this happen to  other writers&mdash;that journals like the <em>TLS</em>&nbsp; and the <em>New  Statesman</em> will give my book to a reviewer whose name identifies that person  as of Indian or Pakistani origin. The person may be, as has happened twice, a  perceptive critic, but the message received by the readers of the journal is  that the review is there as a sort of gesture to affirmative action and not for  any compelling literary reason. Not long ago&mdash;unbelievably, as recently as the  1960s&mdash;it was the practice of some London papers to bunch together brief reviews  of novels written by women and to print the piece at the bottom of the page  under the heading, <em>Novels by Women</em>.  The reader knew what he need not bother with; similarly, who is going to bother  when a Ghose is reviewed by a Chaudhari?</p>
            <p>Every society, being composed of human beings who are driven to  assert power or superiority over other human beings, whether or not they have  any talent in the field of their activity, and often especially when their  talent is a mediocre one, be that society a nation or the department of English  at a university, establishes a caste system the purpose of which is to  eliminate any threat to the power structure by consigning its difficult members  into oblivion by branding them <em>untouchable</em>.</p>
            <p>But it is too easy to make  a list of grievances, give oneself the martyred air of a victim, and accuse  another group of discriminatory bias to explain away the neglect of one&rsquo;s own  work and to find a reason for one&rsquo;s being marginalised as an untouchable. </p>
            <p>The fact is that the opposite of the argument that has been  advanced so far is also true. </p>
            <p>There must be many an English writer who seeing another Indian or  Sri Lankan win the Booker Prize must complain that the judges were favouring  the former colonial subjects for political reasons and not looking at literary  quality. Just as there is no doubt that affirmative action laws have given some  jobs to minority candidates not as well qualified as the white applicants,  similarly post-colonial guilt is responsible for a number of very inferior  writers from the former colonies being accorded reputations and awards which  have nothing to do with literary merit.</p>
            <p>The very thing that works against us, the former non-white colonial  subjects&mdash;national origin&mdash;is sometimes the reason for our success. I encountered  this dilemma almost as soon as I began to publish poems in London, in 1959. Writers from the former  British colonies were a new phenomenon. Dom Moraes and I from the Subcontinent,  Wole Soyinka from Nigeria,  and a few others were among the first poets from the recently independent  countries to be published in England.  Suddenly a new category was born: Commonwealth literature. Next thing,  publishers began to produce anthologies of Commonwealth poetry with their own  little nationalistic pigeon holes and I found myself in demand for the simple reason  that I was identified as having been born in Pakistan. It had nothing to do with  the quality of one's work. Poetry readings, literary festivals, etc., followed:  one was in demand because one could be labelled. </p>
            <p>Being included under this label gave us more opportunities (for  some, the only opportunity) to be published but at the same time such  confinement within a category guaranteed the continuation of our status as  untouchables. But here&rsquo;s the dilemma: those of us who have acquired a  reputation by being included in anthologies of Commonwealth literature and  university courses in ethnic studies have been given opportunities to be  published and to be studied which are denied to writers from the &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo;  who don&rsquo;t possess the alien characteristics that form our peculiar distinction:  in other words, the very thing that creates opportunities for us, and places us  in a privileged situation, is the thing we accuse of branding us as untouchable  and throwing us into a ghetto. But to the mainstream folks our complaint of  being thrown into a ghetto must sound like having one&rsquo;s cake and whining, while  one&rsquo;s mouth is still full eating a big chunk of it, that it tastes bitter. </p>
            <p>While the so-called Commonwealth writers were being increasingly  accepted in England from the 1960s, that was also a revolutionary time in the  United States where a new attention to civil rights led to the creation of  Black Studies programmes at the universities: one more category with its hunger  not for quality but for quantities of relevant subject matter. Some of the  English writers from the former African and Caribbean  colonies were assimilated into Black Studies. But these academic programmes  which were created as a liberating act, with the grand aim of breaking down the  hegemonic tyranny of the white-European-male dominated tradition, had the  effect of creating another ghetto: one was there because one belonged to a  narrowly defined group, the colour of one&rsquo;s skin. It had nothing to do with  being a writer in the English language. In other words, that which had opened  as an avenue of success was no more than a dead-end street. </p>
            <p>But imagine a world in which there are no hierarchical  socio-political categories. There would still, of course, be a group of  untouchables. Wherever human beings find themselves in a competitive arena  their instinct is to seek a reason to exclude others. Race and colonial  attitudes are only recent symptoms of a malady that is ancient. Its real name  is envy. And envy is so subtle a disease that those worst afflicted by it  believe themselves to be wholly immune to it, and are loudest in proclaiming  how much they suffer from the narrow prejudices of others. Even the great  Tolstoy suffered from it and attacked Shakespeare, possibly because he found no  one else greater than himself that he could be envious of; in our own time,  Conrad and Nabokov have been attacked by writers who have taken a sanctimonious  political and moral stance to mask their incapacity to respond to the formal  beauty of a work of art and do not realise that the expression of their public  outrage is one of the disguises assumed by envy.</p>
            <p>Nationalistic exclusivity and other labelled categories thrive  upon a contemptuous rejection of, or total indifference to, aesthetic values.  Categories encourage the neglect of the formal quality of a work of art because  they demand that judgement be based solely upon some ideological consideration.  Orwell said that, &lsquo;what are supposed to be purely aesthetic judgements are  always corrupted to some extent by moral or political or religious loyalties.&rsquo;  Not quite true. I don&rsquo;t see how my delight in the structure of a Shakespeare  sonnet&mdash;my amazement at the poet&rsquo;s organisation of language and my consequent  experience of a thought that transcends all socio-political considerations and  occurs in my mind only as an experience of <em>beauty</em>&mdash;can  by said to be corrupted by &lsquo;moral or political or religious loyalties&rsquo;. Unless,  of course, it is argued that the sacredness I attach to aesthetics is a  fundamentalist sort of religious loyalty. But even if my reading of a text is  thus a corrupted one, I would add that time eliminates the corruption and  reveals the work for what it is: if it survives, it is only because its formal  beauty evokes the abstract thought which generates in a reader&rsquo;s mind that  literary pleasure which is unrelated to socio-political ideas, if any there are  in that text.</p>
            <p>There is a part of me&mdash;perhaps no more than an abstract shadow&mdash;that  merges into, and becomes, Orwell in that we both are to a greater or lesser  degree part of the literature composed in the English language; then there is  the other in me, the human organism obliged to suffer the fate of a political  animal whose history and genetic composition make him both privileged, as a  token representative of his group, and a victim, as a marginal figure in  another people&rsquo;s culture. And then there are times when I find both these chaps  too tiresomely serious and become a third self, one who is amused by the  spectacle of human vanity and, laughing at the awful seriousness of scholars  embroiled in theoretical speculation, remembers what his friend the novelist A.  C.&nbsp; H. Smith said once: &lsquo;When language  Ghose, everything Ghose.&rsquo;</p>
