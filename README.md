# interlitq-original-files
These are the original files for interlitq.org from 2007 - 2017. The code was developed in 2007 by an unknown programmer. This content is being migrated to a WordPress-based CMS. 

All content existed as static files wrapped in PHP files. The PHP simply pulled in the header, sidebar and footer. No dynamic database backend existed.
