            <p><strong>In the Future</strong></p>
             
            <p>all exams will contain four Morton Feldman questions:</p>
             
            <p>1) List from most accessible to least accessible all 181 of Feldman&rsquo;s compositions<br>
            2) Name three people Feldman made love to<br>
            3) Hum <em>Rothko Chapel</em><br>
            4) What does sound mean?</p>
            
            <p>In the future,</p>
            <UL>
              <LI>
                All corporate jingles will derive 	from Feldman&rsquo;s music
              <LI>
                The beat of the human heart has 	been proven to be atonal              <LI>
                Before dinner, it is customary to 	read a Morton Feldman essay or two
              <LI>
                The word &ldquo;boredom&rdquo; now means 	&ldquo;a state of liminal ecstasy&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;This sex that we&rsquo;re 	having on the edge of an Aegean cliff, Turkish heroin electrocuting 	our veins, is boring&rdquo;
              <LI>
                To express excitement or approval 	for the home team at sporting events, the crowd goes silent
              <LI>
                Jazz has been declared &ldquo;silly&rdquo;
              <LI>
                The French are derided as 	hopelessly narrow-minded
              <LI>
                Density of conversation, as in 	talking too much when one is talking, and then making no sounds at 	all when one is not talking, is considered a hallmark of genius
              <LI>
                Anecdotes are traded on the stock 	exchange, where Feldman anecdotes remain the most valuable. Like 	this one,

            <p>Feldman was dying in the hospital in Buffalo. The cancer had spread too quickly. Barbara was with him, and he was ready, telling her he had lived a full life and had no regrets. Only one thing was bothering him, the beep of the EKG machine. &ldquo;It sounds like something I would have written,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;like hearing myself thinking.&rdquo; He asked the nurse if she could turn it off. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s against the law,&rdquo; she said. Could he could play a record over it? What if he called in a few friends and they hooked themselves up to one, too? By now snow was falling into the dusk, and the situation was hopeless. Feldman took Barbara&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;I know how to stop the beeping.&rdquo; And then he did.</p>

            <p><strong>A Famous Anecdote in Reverse</strong></p>
            
            <p>Jackson Pollack!<br>
            A man walking with his hands in his pockets<br>
            The intersection of 6th Ave &amp; Fourteenth St. <br>
            Feldman turns and looks<br>
            Wolpe points toward the street<br>
            What about the common man?<br>
            I care about the sounds<br>
            It&rsquo;s too esoteric<br>
            Feldman plays<br>
            Play it<br>
            I brought something new<br>
            Have a cup of tea<br>
            Wolpe!<br>
            Feldman!<br>
            The tea is boiling<br>
            Steps creak<br>
            The long subway ride<br>
            The sun rises<br>
            Strange, indecipherable dreams</p>
            <p><BR>
            </p>
             
            <p><strong>Buffalo &lsquo;86</strong></p>
             
            <p>The snow in Buffalo blows<br>
            to and fro<br>
            burying cars along the avenue home.</p>
             
            <p>No<br>
            one&rsquo;s inside to turn their radios on<br>
            so<br>
            silence plays silently to no one—<br>
            
            <p>rows of sunken clouds<br>
            domes of metal, leather and snow.<br>
            
            <p>I can&rsquo;t open the window<br>
            so the television&rsquo;s on—<br>
            news like a fog horn<br>
            an always-ringing phone</p>
             
            <p>the fathers and husbands of Buffalo<br>
            emerging, at dawn, from their homes—</p>
            
            <p>heavy-clothed<br>
            armed with brushes and shovels.</p>
           
            <p>One by one<br>
            they scrape off the snow<br>
            the engines turn on</p>
            
            <p>and I open the lid of my piano.</p>
